Voters in multiple states can check their absentee ballot status & fix it if it was rejected. Here are some important links & deadlines:

GA (11/6)- https://georgia.ballottrax.net/voter/

"BREAKING: Lehigh County, PA just flipped to Biden. It was red since Tuesday."
"Watching Trump's lead in Pennsylvania go from hundreds of thousands to just 90,000 with 11% of the vote still to come has been so crazy."
Georgia down below 10k now!
"Imagine telling a state you can't count the mail in ballots early and then sue because it's taking too long to count the mail in ballots. 

Trump and his supports are fantastic gymnasts."
"No matter what happens in Georgia at this point, I am SO proud of the peach state. Trump won here by 5 points in 2016, and the fact that it's this close is so amazing. Huge thanks to Stacy Abrams and others who have helped and motivated voters in Georgia!"
Gonna be wild when Fox News suddenly thinks COVID-19 is a serious problem in 70 days

"I have done countless research scouring through the electoral map to find out what county in the USA had the highest percentage of votes for Trump. I have determined that Roberts County of Texas has been deemed the world’s worst place to live.

Trump: 529 votes (96.2%)

Biden: 17 votes (3.1 %)

Jorgensen: 4 votes (0.7%)

Fun fact: It was also the highest in the country back in 2016. [Here’s an interesting article.](https://abcnews.go.com/amp/Politics/roberts-county-year-pro-trump-town-america/story?id=52364233) 

The county’s only township, Miami (pronounce my-am-uh), tried to seek out who voted for Hillary back in 2016. Those who did were too scared to come forward for an interview."
"Biden has been winning the ballot dumps in Pennsylvania with a share of 70-80%.

To be clear, Biden only needs 60% share to win Pennsylvania, so he's overperforming by 15-20 points.

"People still don’t seem to understand how much McCain hated Trump.

McCain was the first politician to publicly battle Obamacare when he ran against Obama in 2008.

He then dealt the finishing blow to Trump and McConnell by voting with Democrats on the ACA vote.

McCain abhorred what the GOP was becoming, and he predicted it. Watch this 60-second video and tell me Trump would ever do this: https://youtu.be/JIjenjANqAk

McCain convinced other republicans to maverick with him and detest Trump. Few did.

McCain directed his family to invite Obama, the man who defeated his ascent to the presidency, to speak at his funeral. All former presidents attended. Trump was not invited.

Finally, McCain defeated Trump soundly. I’m a democrat, as you could probably guess, but this was the election of McCain."

Joe Biden will win Pennsylvania.

There are approximately 500,000 outstanding mail votes from urban areas left to count before Pennsylvania is done.

Biden's margin is around 160,000.

In every single state, Biden gets something like 7 in 10 of all urban mail-in votes. Assuming that holds in PA as it did everywhere else, that's approximately 350,000 votes. Trump of course gets the other 150,000.

The margin flips and Biden wins PA by around 40,000 votes.

Stop worrying about Arizona and Nevada and Georgia, because Joe Biden will win Pennsylvania and become the next president.

David Perdue, running for state senate of Georgia, has gone below 50%. If this holds, there will be 2 runoff elections for Georgia in January of 2021 and if the Democrats win both they would tie the Senate at 50-50 with VP Kamala as the tie breaker. Could be HUGE."

"The date is July 7th, 2038. Pennsylvania is in is 284th recount. Nevada's vote tally has its 254th court case disputing the results. California has fallen into the Pacific Ocean, casting its votes into doubt. Soothsayers  interpret the tweets of the pickled head of Donald Trump. Joe Biden's re-animated corpse hungers for brains and the hair of children. The Atlanta Falcons blew a 28 point lead against the Saskatoon Lumberjacks. Gangs of super-covid C.H.U.D.S. roam our streets. The election is Still. Not. Over. May God have mercy on us all….. Meanwhile, in the high desert, RoboMcCain leads a ragtag gang of scrappy patriots and ne'er-do-wells as they battle MechaElon and his army of Amazonian drones for control of a warehouse full of the last Charmin on earth….


....Elsewhere, Count Bernie Sanders, powered by individual blood donations of 2cc or less, rises from his summer crypt on Martha's Vinyard, as the hunters moon gleams high above, to stalk the wasteland that was the East Coast, his raspy voice carrying across the unending plains of ash and dust, moaning and wailing as he searches for plump, young progressives he can suck dry of their hopes and dreams...its said that to this very day you can hear his voice traveling over the ruin that was once the capital, whispering through the wind to lost travelers about corrupt campaign finance systems Those still loyal to him know he can be summoned by reciting the incantation ""I am once again asking for your support”….

...In the Heartland, Mitch McConnell, having completed his phylactery, ascends to lichdom, his gaunt and withered flesh stretched taut across horribly visible bones. He hungers. The serfs of Kentuckianasee report seeing crimson eyes weeping blood in their dreams. The tomacco crops fail. The land is blighted with pustulent flies. As he gathers his army of the brain-dead, he harvests the flesh of the innocent for his bio-fuel reactors. Once he has amassed enough to power his convoy of suped-up Ford F350's with lift kits and truck nuts the gates of his mountaintop redoubt will open and madness will descend upon the land…..
.....
.....While Arch-Magos Pence has assumed control of the U.P. His knights of the cross dwindle in numbers, however. There is rot at the heart of his crptyo-fascist paradise. Those loyal to him spend their time in debauched orgies and idle buggery. His agents scour the Nation for fertile wombs, that he may extend his bloodline, but it is no use. After copulation they just can't stop shitting long enough for his seed to take root. It is said that Arch-Magos Pence never ages, however a portrait of him that hangs in the ruins of the White House grows so disturbingly obscene that to gaze upon it is to invite madness.

How Long, oh Lord, How Long must we suffer? Is there balm in Gilead? There is none. There is only endless pain and uncertainty, a lovecraftian nightmare of unyielding terror and howling madness, with election results 'just around the corner'. The citizens of this once-proud nation file silently into re-education centers, where the chimneys never stop spewing sickly gouts of ash into the unending night sky and the last words they hear are ""Stop resisting. We've been trying to reach you regarding your vehicles extended warranty. Stop resisting. We've been trying to reach you regarding your vehicles extend warranty. Stop resisting.....”

……..A rumor spreads, hope arises from the west. Kanye has gathered his forces, a new breed of human made indestructible by an infusion of yeezy and Cristal. They march on the land, smoking phreaked black & milds and wearing $600 white t-shirts which can never be stained, can never be torn. As the final battle looms ahead the rest of the globe watches and remarks ""what the hell is wrong with your country?”

It is too late for me. I have grown weary, my brain turned to warm pudding from seeing too many state maps with red and blue counties. Save yourselves! The borders are shut. We cannot get out. Drums in the deep, but the borders are shut. We cannot get out."

I find it hilarious that Trump is so fucking mad they won't let him in front of a camera.
Fucking great. Shitler is going to speak. This ought to be fucking outrageous.

My Trump supporter grandfather just said he felt insulted and disgusted after listening to that press conference. He didn’t even watch the entire thing. I definitely think my grandfather is 2nd guessing ever supporting him after seeing how he’s handled this process

Edit: added Wisconsin and Michigan cause duh."
I'm like 90% sure the split call to project AZ is the reason NV hasn't been called.
I want Trump to call in Hannity and have Pennsylvania to be called and Hannity has to give him the results.
Shame the All Lives Matter peeps dont think All Votes Matter
Perdue's vote share has now dropped to 49.95%. His lead over Ossoff is still too large for him to catch up probably but if this pattern continues we will have 2 senate races in the special election in January 2021 and an actual possibility for flipping two seats to make the senate 50-50 and dump Mitch McConnel from the senate majority leader position.
90k in PA and 9k in GA
Are they announcing PA or GA today? Sweet jesus just let it end
9k difference in Georgia. Holy shit!
Perdue dropped under 50%!
"In the latest Georgia update Trump's lead shrunk from 12,771 votes to 9,525"

Update us when something real happens and put prime time TV back on the air"
"Forget georgia and the rest for now. They're not getting called til tomorrow at the earliest. PA should have enough done today to get a call and it will be Biden.

Edit: as has been pointed out, PA prob won't count enough tonight to get to the flipping point where everyone should feel comfortable calling it. But, I still think they'll get their before anyone else finishes. Hopefully by tomorrow morning."

Which is THE state that will be called that makes Biden's inevitable win official?"
"okay call me crazy, but that one journalist asking questions in Harrisburg right now sounds eerily like Phyllis Vance"
It has to be frustrating being in this position.  Answering the same questions 6 times over to questions that are easily answered by going to the website.  It’s like being a school teacher to a group of really lazy children.

"PA, please flip during his press conference. Please give us this gift."
"I love that the president’s own advisors have to be worried about him speaking because of the outlandish things he may say.

He’s going to call it rigged and say that he really won, then Pence is going to speak and walk it back.

Honestly, I expect him to call for his supporters to storm the counting facilities to stop the counting."
"When this is over it seems like it won't have actually been that close. Just a quirk of all how the votes will have been released. Barring a shock turnaround seems very likely Biden will pick up Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, and Pennsylvania.

That's of course also ignoring the popular vote even which will likely end up being a very comfortable margin."
"Trump should be conceding, but I'd be fucking shocked if he did."

">When a man unprincipled in private life desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper, possessed of considerable talents, having the advantage of military habits — despotic in his ordinary demeanour — known to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty — when such a man is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity — to join in the cry of danger to liberty — to take every opportunity of embarrassing the General Government & bringing it under suspicion — to flatter and fall in with all the non sense of the zealots of the day — It may justly be suspected that his object is to throw things into confusion that he may ‘ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.’

"I think we all need to remember one very important precedent of the past four years: The Dershowitz Principle. If, after the fact, the President can tie his acts to advancing some sort of legitimate step in furtherance of US interests, no matter how indirectly connected, nothing he does is illegal.

So, I vote that Biden order the military to strap Mitch McConnell, Bill Barr, and the whole Trump family to a rocket, and blast them into outer space. After all, space research is a legitimate policy goal so it can’t be illegal!"

Per my earlier post, biden should continue getting at least 54 % statewide in GA to win. This update seems to be well matched with that.

It was starting to get dark downtown, and when that happens in ATL, the city changes. He informed me that at least 5 people just watched me take my wallet out and that they would likely try to get me for it. He offered to walk us back to our car. The man was 5’10 220 solid muscle. He called himself “Dirty”. When we arrived at the car, we embraced. I told him to take care of himself, and he responded “You too. Hey if you’re ever back in Atlanta and you need that work done, you can always find Dirty around the bus station”. I said “Bet” and that was the last I ever saw of him.

My eyes are super focused on the Alaskan Senate race right now.  From what I've heard from campaign folks that I know, they believe they can account for around 105-110,000 out of the 161,000 absentees (through voter outreach) to be for Dr. Gross. The other \~60,000 votes are unaccounted for but is not a guaranteed to be all for Senator Sullivan.

So assuming worst case scenario that all of the 60k unaccounted for votes are going for Senator Sullivan:

&#x200B;

118,978 + 56,000 = 174,978

61,362 + 105,000= 166,362

"Even though I dont actually feel bad for Santorum sometimes I feel like CNN is just like ""Answer for your peoples stupid decisions you LITTLE MORON"""
"If we're including this election, Republican presidential candidates will have lost the popular vote in *7 of 8 elections* (Bush/Kerry '04 being the exception). More striking to me is that in the 21st Century, *both times a Republican has taken the White House from a Democrat, they've lost the popular vote,* by a noticeable margin the first time (1/2 million), and a *significant* one the second (2.6 million votes).

Biden *already* has a larger popular vote lead than Hillary did in 2016 with every vote counted (3.6 million and growing, to 2.6 million), so even in the extreme scenario of Trump somehow still winning the EC by arguing his laughable/completely anti-democratic take that continuing to count legally cast ballots is ""stealing,"" the Republican trend of losing the popular vote but squeaking by in the EC would  only continue to a now ludicrous degree.

In short, they know they can't win if all the votes are counted, which they're being especially blatant about this time: a Trump campaign legal advisor just came out and said, [""We're waiting for the United States Supreme Court - of which the President has nominated three justices - to step in and do something""](https://twitter.com/MattNegrin/status/1324480669624487944?s=20) and for Amy C Barrett to *""come through.""* What do they want them to step in and do? Prevent the candidate *the clear majority voted for* from winning for the now *3rd time* *in just the last two decades*, and the ***2nd time in a row,*** by the *largest margin yet.*"
I wonder if Trump will call for violence. I'm pretty worried about it actually
"Is it Rick Santorum's job to pretend to peddle this bullshit? Or does he actually, genuinely believe it? Because if it's the latter, then he's an idiot. If it's the prior, he's a scumbag."
Santorum getting punched repeatedly on CNN.
Conceding is usually just the traditional and polite thing to do. Trump is neither of those things.

**GA**: Trump leads by 9.5k votes. There are about 43k votes still to be counted. Biden needs 60.91% of those votes to win GA and has been averaging 69.9%. GA is worth 16 electoral votes.

**NC**: Trump leads by 76.7k votes. There are about 190k votes still to be counted. Biden needs 70.13% of those votes to win NC and has been averaging 50%. NC is worth 15 electoral votes.

**NV**: Biden leads by 11.4k votes. There are about 146k votes still to be counted. Trump needs 53.9% of those votes to win NV and has been averaging 43.6%. NV is worth 6 electoral votes.

**PA**: Trump leads by 90.5k votes. There are about 431k votes still to be counted. Biden needs 60.49% of those votes to win PA and he's been averaging 72.7%. PA is worth 20 electoral votes.

If the trends hold:

Trump will win AZ and NC, worth 26 more electoral votes giving him a total of **240**.

Biden will win GA, NV, and PA, worth 42 more electoral votes giving him a total of **295**.

GA might end up at a 3 digit difference between the two candidates tbh. Everyone who didn't vote should be ashamed of themselves there.
Biden should end up winning GA by at least 5k votes. Harris county was the only county remaining that voted for Trump and their absentee ballots went for Biden.

"The way this has unfolded has really ruined Trumps strategy.  He is behind, so he can’t argue to stop the counting, or he’s done.  But if they keep counting, he is also done.

People like to say BLM and ""their"" rioting is what turned people off from Biden, but their ground work is the only thing that kept this race alive."
"If there was a CNN RPG video game, I'd put the following in my party:

Dana Bash (spells and healing powers)

Anderson Cooper (electricity-based attacks)

Chris Cuomo (speaking attacks, like he unnecessarily rhymes to confuse enemies)

Don Lemon (laughing attacks, finds his enemies ridiculous and this hurts their feelings)

I might put John King in because his Magic Screen abilities would let me check HP and MP on the fly and compare it with how my HP/MP was doing during previous sections of the game. Useful data."

"This election is gonna be very confusing when it comes to how to forecast future elections. 

One one hand turnout exploded this cycle... unfortunatly for the Democrats this didn't translate to another blue wave like they were hoping as turnout increased dramatically for both sides.   Still.... the more people participate the better it is for democracy period.  

Going forward where do the democrats go..  Was this huge turnout for them just do to an ""anti-Trump"" sentement.   Do you expect that same crowd to turn out in the 2022 mid-terms, or in the 2024 general, assuming the GOP attempts to nominate a more ""convential/non-Trumpian"" candidate in 2024 will the load of ant-Trump voters not turn out?  

And on the GOP side of things... where do they go for here.  If the GOP attepmpts to revert to a more 2008/2012 more traditiaonl GOP ticket, will that invoke the ire of the GOP voter base?   Or do they go all in on the populist bent they've been on the past 6 years and insist on a more Trump-like candidate.  Do they split the party? 

I honestly do not know and this election leaves alot in the air going forward that's frankly concerning for both sides."

I'm still waiting for the October Surprise.
CBS reporting that Trump will not concede if Biden declares victory
Lmao. We aren't gonna know shit until tomorrow.

"biden just 9,500 votes back in Georgia right now... will he have enough to turn it?"
Damn I remember I started lurking on thread 29.
let's go GEORGIA ~~~~ plz
Clayton County and Chatham County will flip Georgia.
"9000 votes left for Biden in Georgia!!

Edit: This is within striking distance."
Damn. Updates from pa had been coming in really fast but now I feel like it’s been a while. I have no more nails to bite
Sheeesh. I was stuck in thread 44. 47 already?!
I'm so curious what the final count for GA will be. Gotta be so friggin close.
"If/When Biden wins, that will surely be the most upvoted post ever, right?"
Perdue runoff!! There's hope for the Senate!!
I don’t see how trump holds on to Georgia with 6 thousand votes left in Clayton
Biden is just above 9k behind Trump. I can taste this win it's so close.
All the talk of flipping PA and GA yet no talk of flipping NC when it seems very possible
Georgia is 9k difference now!
Ga under 10k
"Oh shit, we’re at the “And I...am Joe Biden” moment"
If Biden hits 75% of the remaining vote in Georgia he wins GA
"You guys remember part 34, that was great."
Do you think they ever find John King alone in the studio asleep pointing on the wall?
Is Katy Tur on? Tell me when Katy Tur is on. I’m going to hide beneath my Snuggie.
"Why do people in Georgia like Perdue? Ossoff seems like a future presidential candidate, yet they want this old guard idiot instead?"
"Stop the count! Give Trump what he wants, Biden won!"
"I had two different republicans say to me today they don’t expect the US to last another twenty years. They both said because of division. 
Just wanted to put that out there, it’s weird to hear so casually in conversation. Our power comes from being such a diverse and large piece of land, nobody would win if we fractured, nobody on this side of the ocean atleast."
Bunker boy hasn’t been seen in public in 48 hours! Sad!

I feel like this whole election has thrown me into a manic episode🤪✌️

Just waiting for GOP to throw Trump under the massive bus at this point. Got to restock my popcorn.
"Pat Toomey was sounding too reasonable for a moment, now he's getting more to his normal self."
Republicans sure do love segregation....
"Any update on NC?  I know it's not really going to factor in, but it's been weirdly sitting there at the same numbers for over a day, hasn't it?"
We really didn't need to hear Pat Toomey's wild conspiracy theories. The GOP are blatantly desperate to find a reason to reject ballots.
This fucker on CNN forgetting that DeJoy sabotaged mail-in voting or something?
"President Trump and his ""Offspring"" god I love Tapper"
Lol I love how cnn keeps referring to trumps children as his “offspring” 😂

I’m tired of hearing about them not letting the observers in. We know what they tried to do once that happened in Michigan: they overwhelmed the room....
D Frump Jr about to make a statement. I'm sure it will be a wise message of unity and democracy
All I know is I want AZ to come in Biden and that analyst from Fox to be right. That call on Tuesday night was the only thing to give me hope.
"I hope someone is working on photoshopping that classic ""Dewey defeats Truman"" photo"
Turned on fox out of curiosity - are they really bragging about trump being such a bad president that nobody else will ever be able to compare?
"The word is there are around 326k votes left to count in PA. These votes have been breaking between 70 - 80% for Biden.

Biden 80% = 260,800
Trump 20% = 65,200

Biden is currently down 90k. If these percentages hold, Biden ends up 105,600 ahead when all is said and done. Biden could get 64% of these and still squeak by.

In order to tie, Trump needs around 37% of the remaining votes. Based on the updates so far and where these votes are coming from, it’s looking very bleak for him."
Wow... They're starting to concede on Fox. And they're calling Trump in 2024!
Pat Toomey is a fucking idiot.
326k votes to go in Pennsylvania.
This guy chanting Fox News sucks behind the MSNBC anchor makes me laugh every time.
This Republican PA senator on CNN sounds like he's in denial lol
"Trump speaking at 6:30 ET, per CNN. This is a reversal of the earlier report that the WH called a lid on Trump appearances today"
"November 12th?  NOVEMBER 12TH?!  What the hell is wrong with you, Nevada?"

"Trump is coming out of his bunker to speak at 6:30pm EST. Hope you guys already have a couple drinks in you because it's going to be infuriating as usual, I'm sure."
"Here's the thing. What if Biden is declared the winner and President-Elect within the next half hour or so? I know it's slim, but what if it becomes super close in the next half hour and Trump still does his conference? Imagine the shitshow."
imagine PA just decides to dump a lot of votes to put Biden in the lead right before Trump speaks
"25th time 

I can live with President Pence for two months"
PA is SINKING. It’s glorious
"even though i knew the gap was diminishing, my jaw still dropped when i heard 78K gap in PA lets goooo"
"Oh god, somebody call this thing before Trump
speaks. Coming from someone living in AZ I’m not liking what these idiots are capable of."
The polls are slowly tightening around Trump like the grip of his tiny hands around a hamberder.
Penn lead down to 78.3k!

78k in PA
"If Trump claims victory and says the Democrats are cheating...this brings everything up a notch, including his armed protestors.

It may be dismissed by lawyers and and judges, but it won't be by his supporters. This is leveling up the crazy."
What the fuck why has Fox News completely stopped their election coverage?  They’re talking about whales.
"I'm not all into Schadenfreude but is there a way to bet on how crazy Trump is going to sound when he speaks?

The man is usually unhinged but now he's basically losing his only protection from going to jail."
Fox news talking about funny animal videos rn LOL
Hopefully they've convinced Trump that the nuclear codes aren't real and are something Hollywood made up.

"Oh god he's going to do a Press Conference at 6:30pm EST

Expect more lies, name-calling, unsubstantiated accusations and one final reminder why America voted this piece of fucking shit out of the White House."

"Ok so the ""late"" ballots in Pennsylvania apparently are being counted and segregated so everything is legal.

Biden currently has the popular vote. Don't know why we don't simply use THAT for who wins an election.
I'm gonna take a break until Trump speaks. That's at 6:30?
Odds Trump rallies the Proud Boys by name?
John king is so adorable to me and I dunno why 🥺
Would be hilarious if the vote ties in Georgia and/or PA right as Trump goes live.
"Fox’s @EricShawnTV just now says he’s spoken to several GOP legal observers who support Trump who have been allowed in to watch ballot count in Philly, “which seems to conflict completely with Trump campaign claims that GOP poll watchers are not allowed in the room.”"
Republicans are seriously crying about voter suppression right now with a straight face...
Why do I have a feeling agent orange is going to rile up all the Yee-hawdis in his speech..
So do you guys think that we see orange makeup smears on Trump's face at 6:30 or what?
"The way John King draws an ""8"" is weird"
"CNN just said those PA votes came from Cumberland, that 66% now looks incredible. He's going to flat out murder Trump when they start counting Philly/Montco/Delco."
"Trump is going to tell everyone to calm down and concede subverting all our expectations.

I hope we can then all be big enough to apologize to D&D for criticizing them about season 8 and Daenerys' ""unrealistic"" last minute character ark"

Holy shit. The utter bullshit coming out of KCs mouth right now.
"Not watching the trump speech, just hearing about it on here. You guys keep us updated on the ugly details?"
"Its a long shot, very long...but the only way I can see him conceding right now is due to his ego. He's more likely to come out and say I'll be back in 2024; this is ridiculous an the fraud is so unfair and so wrong and so mean..maybe the meanest ever. He's going to focus on wiping out his GOP enemies and rebuilding the party to MAGA 2024. 

But in reality, in his head he left the presidency rather than having PA being called for Biden and ""losing"" it. 

Yeah, not likely.."
Rick needs to stfu and go home
"Alright people, this is probably his last press conference before Biden is president-elect, so let's just get through this."

Stop giving santorum a platform please.

Can we get John King back? This shit annoying
I sure hope that we get a state call before Trump speaks. How great would that be? Steal the wind from the windbag's sails.
The funny thing is Santorum thinks he's winning this. You can see it on his face.
"I can't wait to hear from President Joseph R. Biden for the first time, and I hope even more to *see* a grinning Bejing Barry right next to him!"

"Kinda nervous for this Trump speech actually.

We all know this shit ain't starting till 645? One of Trumps power moves if you will is showing up late.
"Hes going to pull a queen cercsei and yell ""I choose violence"""
"Should Trump say anything particularly wild it seems the bulk of the GOP won’t back him (given McConnell’s comments earlier). So a question - if he does and still loses convincingly what the next steps be?

Is there potential for impeachment even at this stage if he were to say, incite violence in some way?"
PA lead down to 75k
Acosta fucking hates him lmao
Acosta loved every single second and word of that interview
Donnie currently doing fat lines before he gets on air
Trump won't concede. Have you slept the past years? He won't declare himself a loser.
"CNN is pulling no fucking punches, lol. Anybody watching FOX? What's the tone like there?"
He has Pilates at 7:30 you heard it here first
every hour Biden makes up about 15k in PA.  At this rate he should have it wrapped up in 5 hours
"The longer he waits, the closer he is to losing Georgia"
“I just signed an executive order to make myself king for ever”
The president has a casual relationship with the Truth.... Quote of the week for me.

"Republican women think women should be at home baking babies , but they run for office?"
Georgia is run by Democrats?
"lmao, is he trying to say ""I may not be given the win, but I did better than they said I would!""..? Is that the closest we'll get to a concession?"
I'm pretty confident this is over for him.
Over 69 million American voters think this guy is great. Think about that.
"CNN really should just cut away, there's no point in broadcasting this shit"

3.5k in Georgia !
How can anyone watch and not think hes an insane narcissist? How can these dumb rednecks who love him support an old fat New York millionaire? He wouldnt even pee on them if they were on fire. Dude doesnt give a fuck about anyone but himself.
I hope this is one the last times I hear this clown speak.
"He keeps saying words like ""dangerous"" and ""violent"" and it doesn't feel like an accident."
"He has no proof of any of his claims. But who cares? What is truth anyway?

He's just a sad old man
GA 3.5k votes!
49.4 / 49.3 % keeps Georgia on my mind.
Jake Tapper calling that sad was amazing
"Holy Shit, Trumps lead in Georgia is down to 3,635!! It's really happening!"
Welp I dunno about you guys but he's totally changed my mind /s
"holy shit, democrats can actually take the senate with 2 georgia runoffs guaranteed.

this is god giving them a fucking chance for blowing it this month. they need to go hard in january."
Even Fox news is struggling to not openly call him out on his bullshit lol
"There is a very big reason why no Republicans are coming to his support.

He's done. They know it. They are done associating themselves with a failure so they can now further their careers."

"Buried in all this news is that Esper, Sec of Defense is resigning....lol"
"According to NBC: Estimated 75,561 votes remain to be counted. Biden down by 3,635. Fulton, Gwinnett, Chatham, Clayton, Cobb, Forsyth and Dekalb counties are responsible for over 85% of the remaining votes. All counties except Forsyth heavily favor Biden. Forsyth is smaller then most of the counties stated above and most likely doesn’t have more then 5,000 votes left to count.

Source: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/georgia-president-results

I’d break it down further into more counties, appx amount of votes per county and percentage favoring Biden, but by the time I did all that Biden probably would have already taken the lead."
Seems funny for a those who pine for state rights to ask the federal courts to save you.
🍑🍑🍑Let's do this Georgia🍑🍑🍑
Georgia on my mind
"In Georgia, still big Biden counties: Clayton and Gwinnett. Will have enough to flip. Then provisional ballots will be bonus. Due to USPS scandals, there will be many of them. They should be more of Biden."
Can we make the Lt. Governor of Pennsylvania president some day? He seems awesome

If Biden gets PA is that the ball game? Is AZ unnecessary at that point ?
Can Biden get 61%* of the remaining Georgia vote for the win???
King so smooth with his Trump shade.
We need 63% of the remaining GA vote to win!!
"NY Times - ""**Jim Rutenberg, in New York** **7m ago**

The Trump campaign filed suit in federal court seeking to stop the counting in Philadelphia, arguing that its observers were denied proper access. A hearing was set for 5:30 p.m.""

Just like the one in Georgia, this will probably get thrown out pretty swiftly."
"47... I can't take it anymore. Dumps twitter is fuuudged Up. And junior ain't helping preserving sanity, more like poring gasoline on a fire."
IDK WHAT TO DO!!! I can’t choose between Kornacki and King!! I love them both too much
Biden's speech better have a trump twitter livestream
Trump using his kids to spread misinformation is disgusting. Add it to the list!
They need to make news shows like PTI with points and muting
I want Fox News to be the first to call so we can collapse this meme timeline.

Like, he's already been told to fuck off with at least one lawsuit, all the stats are pointing to a Biden presidency and this guy is *never* the loser.

Trump will incite violence in his speech tonight. Just watch
Big surprise that Trump is pissed that other GOP lawmakers won't help him undermine this election and subvert the will of the people.
So obviously Trump is gonna try to get his MAGA crazies to riot outside the vote counts so they have to halt the vote for now and just sit here and he can fan flames for as long as possible. He is a very simple man.

Also for the love of God, get Biden in a bunker or something. Seeing him on CNN being outside just getting in his car makes me nervous. There are million of batshit insane Trump culties some of which already have tried to kill politicians."

78K in PA!
"It’s mind blowing that when something goes against Republicans in the election, the most probably and sensible explanation in their minds is mass national voter fraud where the other candidate is “stealing” the election. And they support a party/candidate that is trying to limit the amount of votes that are accepted, in a democracy lol who then alleges that democrats are trying to disenfranchise voters lol. Like what. 

They can’t believe that more people than ever before came together to vote against an openly racist, sexist, narcissistic, and uncaring “president” who has killed over 200k Americans and hasn’t been attending coronavirus meetings for weeks/months. This shit isn’t all about Republicans vs Democrats. It’s about having a genuine person in office that gives a shit about things other than spreading lies and talking shit across the isle."

Obviously neither of those will happen, but this is going to be a shit show of epic proportions. I'm sure he's been raging the last two days as he's seen his leads dwindle. I'm sure his internal numbers are telling him he's toast...can't wait to hear him call for violence, call out the GOP, vow to go to the courts etc..etcc..etc..."

Trump has 3 paths, which require him winning out in all but at least 1 state and he has to get PA at any rate (obviously bc that puts Biden over 270) (PA+NC+GA+AZ, PA+NC+GA+NV, PA+GA+AZ+NV)."

come on PA, turn blue!"
"My favorite take so far is that there was a blue wave this year. There was also a red wave. Trump drew out a lot of new and not typical voters who voted straight R, and conservatives who didn’t vote for him still voted down ballot R. 

We have more votes this year than any other year, and Trump has more votes than any other candidate in history (other than Biden of course). This is what happens when everyone comes out. Hopefully we will soon see Biden won. 

McConnell is starting to work on a new republican strategy, indicating there will be a stimulus this year and it will include aid for localities and states. This is a big change. 

I’m not saying it’s over, or that it will be all sunshine and roses here on out, but there are some signs that the republicans see the writing on the wall that Trump helped them, but that they will not be able to repeat this performance so they need to change things. They need more college educated voters, and truck parades won’t get them there."

"**Reminder: The senate and electoral college are literally right wing power grabs against the people.**

The EC was explicitly created to favor slave states. Slaves weren't allowed to vote, so slave holding states would never win a popular vote. When they ""allowed"" slaves to be 3/5 of a person, it gave slave holding states have an artificial boost in electoral votes since the population was higher, but slaves still couldn't vote, so it was just a small number of slave owners that were winning a bulk of electoral votes.[ That's the beginning of the electoral college.](https://www.history.com/news/electoral-college-founding-fathers-constitutional-convention)

>The result was the controversial “three-fifths compromise,” in which enslaved Black people would be counted as three-fifths of a person for the purpose of allocating representatives and electors and calculating federal taxes. The compromise ensured that Southern states would ratify the Constitution and gave Virginia, home to more than 200,000 slaves, a quarter (12) of the total electoral votes required to win the presidency (46).

The senate works out the same way because it gives a smaller amount of people significantly more power. [State lines are literally just gerrymandering. 
](https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/05/08/how-republicans-gerrymandered-the-senate/)

>[T]he reason why there are two Dakotas — despite the fact that both states are so underpopulated that they each only rate a single member of the House of Representatives to this day — is because Republicans won the 1888 election and decided to celebrate by giving themselves four senators instead of just two."

With Maine going back to Rep Susan Collins, and Michigan going back to Dem Gary Peters, the current count stands at 48-48. 

NC is too close to call (mail in ballots can arrive until Nov 12 and be counted), but is leaning Rep right now. Tillis is ahead by around 100,000 votes at the moment. 

In the Georgia Regular Election, it seems like Rep Perdue will narrowly end up in a runoff by failing to secure 50% of the vote (currently 49.9x%). 

Alaska seems assured to easily re-elect Rep Dan Sullivan. 

So, realistically it is looking like a 48-50 Senate, before the two Georgia regular and special election runoffs. 

Basically, Dems flipped AZ and CO, lost AL for a net gain of +1, before the two Georgia runoffs."

My family is working class low income and none of us have gone to college. Trump has done nothing for me and my family these 4 years."
Van jones just took a dump on Santorum
Santorum is such a partisan hack. He’s twisting around any possible way to justify Trumps bullshit.
"Pennsylvania is at -900 now.

Biden is at -1100 for the general election."
"CNN getting real heated, this is incredibly interesting to watch as an Australian."
I wonder if he is quitting so that he does not “lose.”
Odds Trump gives this speech from AF1 on his way to Russia
can’t wait to see *former* president trump
"Trump has tweeted:  https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1324493225579696129?s=20 

Ominous. I wonder if he'll be on time to this one - because this is serious shit. His entire livelihood is in jeopardy right now."

My money is on martial law
Holy shit Acosta almost got me in tears
LOL shes drinking a cold one on air.
Kind of wish CNN had a delay on Trump speech just in case
"Let me guess. 

He's late for this super important announcement"
"Trump got the GOP all these seats, but will lose the White House LOL"
"press conference is running late

cause trump hasnt ran anywhere since school"
I think Trumps cooked in Pennsylvania. AZ might not even be needed.
"Tweet announcing 6:30pm news conference has been deleted, I think?"
i hope he doesn't speak. he can't be trusted to speak right now.
Anyone have a link to that great data scraping site?
"Fuck, these guys are going to incite some shit. I guarantee it."
"""The president has a very casual relationship with the truth"""
"""we are not in belarus"" lmao."
"""I'm not going to do what everyone thinks I'm going to do......and FREAKOUT!"""
lmao Ive never seen Trump so deflated
CNN headlines are the only serotonin I have
Fucking orange fuck.
Where the hell are the sane people at? He is going to cause civil unrest
He sounds hoarse. Been screaming too much?
Straight up lying this shouldn’t even be aired
I love CNN chryons
"""I'll try spinning, that's a good trick."""
"he looks sad, is he hydrating enough w the diet coke cans?"
Full dictator mode
He's totally gone.  It's complete.
He's going to be SUCH a sore loser about this. I can't wait.
Suppression polls?! Lmfao
MSNBC noped out like 20 seconds in. lol
He’s been crying
And? What's your fucking point?
Hes never going to shut up about winning Florida and Ohio
"I won this, I won that, Democrats are evil.

Same old shit."
this is not real life
"""If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it.""

Least charismatic Trump appearance ever. His handlers have him stuck to this script like glue
Why is his hair blurry but everything else is sharp?
Lil xan
Won? You did not win..
A pipe burst so my votes weren't counted??
[deleted]
He seems so... off even by his standards. What a weird little rambly press conference.
Santorum is sweating trying to figure out the mental gymnastics he'll use to defend Trump after this speech.
He just said he won Michigan. Wut
"he sounds like he's been yelling and cursing a lot

hes at bargaining stage"
"You know he's trying all he can, he knows him losing the election is not remotely the worse thing for him, the worse is what will happens when he lose the privileges he has now. He's gonna run from the law.

Desperate and dangerous."
Isn't Georgia's governed republican?
Trump says we won’t let anyone silence voters literally as he is trying to silence voters
"""Can't allow people to silence our voters"" yet he works to silence democrat votes."
"#KEEP

#COUNTING


these SOSs can't stop tonight"
So its fine if *you* (trump) win Arizona now at this point in time but if biden wins the states that are left its fraud? Sounds about right.
Bitching about Philadelphia and Detroit is just another way for Trump to slam black voters.
I don’t care what Trump has to say and NOBODY should. He’s human garbage
He's calling for violence.
"""People had to use binoculars"" lmao"
[deleted]
Don’t all the poll places have fucking CCTV that is live online?
All these flavors and you chose to be salty
He is just making shit up now
"trump logic: if you can't see votes being counted, they're illegal"
"Georgia, please do the right thing and let the Demo grabs the seat this run-off"
"I wore an onion on my belt, as was the style at the time..."
They are tied by percentage in GA
What evidence and what proof?
15 minutes of rambling. Probably loses his voice in 3 minutes. Hopefully
"You guys think he's looking down at a childrens farm animal book to keep him sated?
And everything he is saying is just un-written stream of ""consciousness"""
ABC just cut him off
"Lol ""this will go throughout a legal process""

Two of your legal process have been thrown out today by judges, dipshit."
"""I have so much evidence, huge amounts of evidence."" Fuck off Cheetolini, you've got nothing and your lawsuits are gonna get tossed."
Trump looks and sounds defeated
3.6k to go in GA. With about 25k to count I believe. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
GA IS DOWN TO A 3.5K GAP IN VOTES!!
CNN is doing a phenomenal job with this coverage
GA gonna get called tonight??
No questions! Blatantly false claims.
4000 Georgia.
"*""As he was talking, I was reaching out to some senior Republicans o ask when the intervention will happen.""* -- CNN"
Has Pence abandoned his dear leader???
Where the fuck is Pence?
"The majority of my friends in Ohio voted using mail-ins

He didn't have shit to say about Cleveland"
i think his party will do just fine. republicans have no memory that they have been wrong on just about every issue over the past 20 years.
He basically said he lost GA LMAO
"Anderson, with that cool lean on the chair"
"Only 3635 votes now in Georgia. As math showed, George will turn blue and will never red again very soon"
Anderson Cooper just called the President of the United States an obese turtle. 2020 is something
"LOL The Fox election desk is legit (unlike their prime-time clowns of Hannity and Tucker), and they are just over this shit as well."
"""He's like an obese turtle on his back flailing around""

Anderson Cooper has no chill"
Damn Anderson really out here swinging lmao
Santorum is making sense? What is happening
This seems like a cathartic moment for Santorum
We knew this was coming.  I didn't expect it to be so pathetic.  He's finally been exposed.  He has no backup.  McConnell and Pence aren't there with him.  He's going out with a whimper.
Rick is about to cry
According to that github website if Biden stays at his current pace % of the vote he would have more than enough votes to take out Trump in PA and GA. Let's fucking get it!!!
"Fuck trump, can’t wait for him to lose."
"3486 vote lead in GA for trump

its flipping

(this is according to ddhq)"
Guys take a look at here: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/election-results/georgia-2020/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/election-results/georgia-2020/) All what's left to count are counties around Atlanta which are blue. It's very likely GA is going to flip!
"Some guy bitching on OAN at a rally in Georgia that the vote count isn't fair and there are all kinds of weird things going on. 

He's not mentioning that the Governor and Sec. of State in Georgia are Republican."
"**List of people who followed Trump's calls for LAW AND ORDER**

"I have faith in AZ and Georgia could turn blue, there is a chance. PA is getting super close. The win for blue is coming."

Biden just shaved 3k off in PA.

Will we be getting anymore updates tonight from PA and/or GA?
"Trump said:

 “In Georgia, I won by a lot, a lot, with a lead of getting close to 300,000 votes on election night,” the president said. “(It) got whittled down, and it’s getting to be to a point where I’ll go from winning by a lot to perhaps being down by a little bit.”

"AOC, 2028 boys!!

I’m just gonna say it: Biden won and Trump is actively trying to find a way to steal it away. No reason for this not to have been called at this point. He’s 100% fucked in PA and NV.

I hope he cyanide capsules himself on live TV.

I came from the future to tell you guys: The year is 2024. US is preparing for election but the counting for 2020 election is still not finished.
Does anyone else think Trump may have attempted to order military action? Secretary of defense just resigned and Jr. is calling for total war.

Trump is going to incite a riot at 6:30
Trumps being allowed out of the bunker!
Anyone else see Fox show a clip of Homer Simpson eating a donut and they said it was Family Guy?
Odds Trump tells his supporters to take to the street at 6:30 pm speech?
Remarkable how many mail in Biden votes coming from red counties in PA. Kinda explains why GOP always wants to make voting harder.
" Trump's lead in Pennsylvania down to 80k votes as Cumberland wraps up its count.  It's yet another county that finishes with a big shift toward Biden v. 2016, which goes from Trump+18 to Trump+11"
Michael Scott from Dunder Mifflin would have been a better goddam president than the current one

One thing I've been paranoid about. What happens when in 4-8 years Republicans find someone who is 10 times worse than Trump but doesn't have any major scandals and can speak in full coherent sentences?
I hope that if Biden gets 270 he doesn't do a victory speech until all states are called.
Someone make me stop going into conservative to see what they’re saying!! It’s crushing my soul.

Biden baited Trump out of the bunker.

What website are u guys using to check votes currently?
"With how the criteria to call AZ, was made, i dont know why biden isnt called by AP for PA yet."
Biden only down 78k in PA
"Just to ease some people's concerns: the 326k votes still remaining in PA are **not** the ballots Trump is trying to throw out via his lawsuit. The PA Sec State doesn't know how many votes are coming in between 11/3 - 11/6 but she knows it's a tiny fraction of the rest of the votes (sounded like maybe 10k at most). Those votes will be separated and remain that way. They can still come in until tomorrow. Even if Trump wins his lawsuit and those votes don't count, it still looks like Biden will be ahead in PA."

"Its 6:30 PM on the east coast, November 5th 2020. Donald Trump approaches the podium to address the nation about the ongoing election. He opens his mouth and sings ""*Weeee have arrived, oooh woah oh, we have arrived*"""
Trump's going full Palpatine @6:30pm
"Biden needs to win 60% of the remaining mail-in vote to take the lead (which he will do), but that doesn't include provisional ballots, which there are likely a lot of.

EDIT: In PA"

I cannot wait to hear Trump speak. He losing it. Literally. Figuratively. Beautifully.
This is John King's Olympics.
CNN has PA up to 79k.  Special party when it his 69k
Is the senate still in play?
My anxiety usually shots up when I have to hear trump speak but I can’t fucking wait for this. Cry for us Donnie boy
I feel like Trump sees Biden being so elegant on stage & his ego gets hurt so he stops listening to his advisors telling them how he has to go on stage as well.
Fox more interested in cute animal videos than the election.
Is Trump going to come out to YMCA??? Lol
"Well, we're on to the cute animal segment of Fox News. You could ask for worse."
I think CNN will be the last place to call the race.
"Trump is so goddamn predictable. Biden went on TV for a few prepared remarks, so Trump, being the jealous toddler he is, has to as well."
Chances Trump tries to incite his base to storm the vote counts?
Wonder what bullshit trumps gonna spew at 6:30.
I dont think trump can keep it together during his speech. He will get crazy and at some pt may call for war.
Has Mitch turtle neck made any comments with regards to the presidential race?
Honestly I’m worried that Trump will call for violence in this press conference...
Fingers crossed the networks do the right and responsible thing and cut him off the minute he starts calling for violence.
Not from the US... But i don't want to miss Trumps meltdown. Is their any way to watch the speech online?
"""why aren't they praising the president?"" = ""why aren't they kissing the ring?"""

How buzzed on Sudafed is Trump going to be in this presser?

That Cumberland count was a dagger imo
"9k in Georgia, has biden got a chance?"
Is Trump's speech (hopefully one admitting defeat) 6:30 est?
Trump is about to concede and then tell us his plans to run in 2024.
If trump does something really stupid at this press conference can he still get impeached?
I've driven a lot in my life but the longest stretch of road for me is the nothingness that is that Erie stretch of PA from Buffalo to Cleveland.
Last batch of votes in AZ was from a rural red county I assume? Aren’t they doing the last urban votes last?
The networks are going to cut away from Trumps presser as he starts the dangerous rhetoric.
"What does Fox and AP know about AZ that we don't?  I keep seeing posts on here with rational explanations, but I'm not seeing it.  Not saying it's wrong, but what do they know and why will the results swing back towards Biden?

EDIT:  Thanks everyone!"

Why did we have to wait 5 years before hearing this, CNN ? I mean we know it is, but calling it 'misleading' or 'untruth' is just bullshit. Lies. Lies is the word you're looking for. And the other word is not 'unconventional', it's 'stupid'."

Any vote for Biden is illegal; so spake the president.
It wasn't a blue wave but it was hardly a red wave
What is happening to trump right now? Ive never heard him read a script like this before
He’s on a 1st grade reading level right now
He can say whatever he wants. He can say unicorns stole the ballots. Doesn’t matter.
"LOL, he is crazed."
How does he go in saying “there’s fake votes” and then go on about how republicans won. These LITERALLY CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME WORLD
Trump sounds like shit
I don't think there's been a president in my lifetime who's made less of an effort to even appear to attempt to unite the country
"Eat a dick, Trump."
someone needs to tell this idiot he's almost down by 4 million nationally without Cali even near fully in
Sure it's being said many times.....  This is just sad.

"Trump is like the non-funny version of Michael Scott. His inadequacy makes him spew false claims about how ""well"" he's done in a news conference."
He sounds depressed. I wonder why.
Does he not really understand how elections work....serious question
"I don’t know that I’ve ever seen him speak in such a dejected manner. He’s barely got any energy. Seems like this has been a huge blow to him. To be fair, however, for the last four and a half years I have made every effort to avoid listening to him speak so take it with a grain of salt."
Feeling so good! Georgia will flip soon and will never look back. It will be blue forever :)
He sounds awful.
"""I was winning, until I wasn't."" - our snowflake *president right now, smh"
Trump just wants to incite violence. His goons are ready.
"Because you want Joe the Plumber to be able to ""observe"" with his AR15 slung over his shoulder, Donny.  That's the problem.  You don't want qualified and trained observers in, you want your army."

trumps losing in arizona and nevada and losing the popular vote.   plus his only chance to win his mail in ballots in arizona wtf is he even talking about
"Your supports were literally pounding on the windows in Detroit, I wonder why they didn't want your people near them"
"Yes. Detroit is indeed, another place."
"he is such a crybaby, fucking pathetic human. So are his hardcore supporters fuck them too"
"Somebody needs to 'Sir, this is a Wendy's' trump. That would be so funny."
Trump : More people voted for Biden instead of me? Wait thats illegal.
This is the long way of saying that their plan of cheating by stopping the mail failed.
"Watching this from Uk: car crash TV. 

Do we think he actually believes what he’s saying?"
If he keeps talking like this Biden is gonna get something called for him before he's done.
I can't think of anything I've ever wanted more than to see Trump's reaction live on TV when he learns Georgia flipped and he's lost. I think the American people are owed this catharsis.
But...but no votes have been cast after Election Day? The fuck?
Because we fucking hate you. This ass clown pressed his supporters to only vote in person that's why all the mail in had Biden's name you fucking doughnut.
"He sounds so sad, he's so melancholy.  There is no energy or power to his words."
"he's conceding, the way he said ""joe"" without an insult and showing respect like him means he's in coping mode."
You are the disgrace Donald
This speech is fucking terrifying. He's basically calling for violence.
"YOU are the disgrace, Donnie boy."
all i feel is cringe
He's despicable. To think of the millions of people that voted for his fucking ass.

"I’m so confused, isn’t it just now three days after the election? How can he accuse democrats of counting votes days after the deadline if it is just now the deadline?"
LOL at the reporter asking him if he's being a sore loser
That was one of the most disgusting things I’ve ever witnessed
wtf did I just watch?
Please tell me that someone has a transcription of that horrible speech.
“Are you being a sore loser?” Lol
Biden at 3.200.000 in PA. Just about 63.000 votes difference.

Based on the new numbers in from PA it looks like Biden needs about 60-63 percent of the outstanding votes to take the lead. This required percentage has been dropping pretty steadily throughout the day. A good sign for Biden.

Before you reply to this question just know that I am functioning on a different level of Stupidity than your average person but I have to ask why don't rich Democrats invest in urbanizing most of Texas? Build a couple of more cities expand a couple up and coming cities and invest in the economy and build business there that will attract more Liberals to migrate there. I guess in simpler terms why don't they build more cities in Red States ? Build more Public Universities near rural areas.

If we’re going to get called socialist and communist with a candidate like Biden. We might as well run as far to the left as possible.
"From what I recall, the AZ votes come in three batches: the first batch is great for Biden, the second batch (coming in now?) leans Trump, and the third batch is supposedly lean Biden. That's what Kornacki said on Day 1 of counting. AP, Fox, and NPR clearly see something in the AZ trends that we have yet to see. And if I remember Sinema's race in 2018, she had a narrow margin and didn't churn out a win until the very last batch of votes, which similarly weren't counted on election night. 

Or maybe AP, etc. got it wrong and will reverse their calls at some point tonight or tomorrow. Who even knows? #2020"

OTOH, I did the same thing for PA based on the remaining votes there and it looks like Biden will win by 100k assuming the 77% Biden skew holds for the remaining ballots to be counted. He still wins even if you knock 10-12 points off of that advantage.

It will require some fuckery for Biden not to assume office in January."

"As far as crazy republicans go, here’s not the worst. Which would be shocking, but by now, nothing would surprise me via a vis us politics"
Toomey is such an ass hole
"lol @ Fox, it's like Battle Royal hahaha"
Major Key (Race) Alert!!! 🔑🔑🔑
Biden!
Toomey is a dumbass

What's Trump gonna say in his remarks?
Is Trump still down in his bunker putting ketchup on well-done steaks?
Trump is going to speak at 6:30 pm EST.
Never in my life have I enjoyed Fox News as much as I am right now.
Did PA update/confirm on how many ballots are left to be reported?
Trump to speak at 6:30pm et per Dana Bash on CNN.
6:30PM Dinner break.
Trump going to speak in half an hour.  I’ll grab the popcorn!
"Oh, Trump is gonna talk"
"Is it still ~9,5k in GA?"
Is Trump going to lose his shit when he speaks or... or is there any other possible outcome?
"Oh my god, He's GOING TO SPEAK?!?!?

Judging by his tweets is that a good idea?"
Trumps lead dropped to 78k votes now
HOLY FUCK. 78K DIFFERENCE IN PA
This is gonna be the wildest Trump speech yet.
Fox News is losing their minds. It’s both great and horrifying at the same time.
"Trump's lead down to 78,314  in PA.

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-pennsylvania-president.html"
Trump’s PA lead dropping like a stone. ~78k now
"""More lies and bullshit from trump, tonight at 6:30 EST"""
Yikes. Sec Def resigned
Prepare for a lot of bad things to happen after Trump's conference.
Would be nice for GA to turn blue before Trump speaks.
78K to go boys!!!!
Can someone update the math on the latest vote data refresh from PA? Is Biden getting enough to flip?
"Jake Tapper's ""You've got to be shitting me"" face is awesome"
[deleted]
Trump is supposed to make a speech here in a little bit probably about the Secretary of Defense looking to resign
Note that Trump picked a time that's just before when PA is expected to flip and before when GA is expected to potentially finalize.
How much was the difference in PA before it was 78k?
Are there betting odds on a call to arms in Trump's speech?
Hahah! He just said Trump is going to lie. I think he nailed it.
Trump at 630 gonna call to liberate America.
any chance Biden victory called until 6:30?
Biden's state looks like a scene from Cars lmao
6:30 huh?  This is going to be a gigantic and possibly dangerous shit show.
"Part of me wants to watch Trump squirm but nah, I'm not giving him the satisfaction."
What time is trump speaking
Penn. still has 300k+ to go through. Might be a while.
I just got up from a nap at the start of discussion 45. What did I miss?
What happened to Savannah Georgia I thought the elections office was supposed have an announcement.
"I went to sleep on Australia last night just as the US East Coast was warming up.  Back now and it doesn't seem like much has happened?  Were the court cases successful in stopping counting, or is it just a very very slow process from here on out?"
Is Trump's speech gonna be livestreamed somewhere like youtube?
"Not a single state has been called today? Holy Christfuck butthole rimjob, am I cranky. This is some sort of goddamn hell, sorry for swearing so much"
So excited for this impending Trump meltdown
"His 6:30 PM EST ""speech"" is gonna be a shameful and baseless rant on how the ""radical left"" is stealing the election. With any luck he will break down into tears mid speech."
What do we predict Trump will say? It's clear he's just trying to stop people talking about how weird it is he's hiding away.
no way he concedes ..he's too narcissistic to do that.
~78k difference in PA now.
"Went to bed last night and still no calls for AZ, NV, GA and PA???"
Rupert Murdoch is having a shit fit right now.
Please tell me someone got a screenshot of homer eating a donut and crediting it to family guy
"Lol at the Drumpfs going for one last cash grab at their base with this defense fund shit

Haven't they ripped these people off enough?

I thought he was a billionaire with tons of $, why does he have to beg for it"
Can we watch any of what you guys speak of somewhere online (not from the US)?
"When should we realistically expect a fucking result? Today is down the tubes, tomorrow doesn’t feel great....Saturday?"
[deleted]
Are we expecting Trump to talk?
So which network will be first to call the election for Biden? Fox News? MSNBC? I feel like CNN will be last to do so.
Who wants to take bets on how many hours Trump has slept since Monday?
"GOP played themselves. If they didn't cause all this bullshit, then MI, WI and PA could've counted and reported their early votes on Tuesday, and we all could've gone to bed by 11 pm. Instead they dragged this out, caused the red miraged, and now all pissed off about everything."
"None of these votes coming from PA today are from Allegheny, right? They still have 30K votes to start counting again tomorrow?"
Maddow’s voice is a tonic.
Steve Kornacki is a fucking beast. How is that man still awake?!
It's gonna be weird going back to reporting on Covid in a few weeks.
"NYT is saying there are still 326,000 mail-in votes to count in PA per their top election official."
Acosta is done with this shit
"If I'm ever scolded by someone, I want to be scolded by Wolf Blitzer"
Trump waiting on that 30mg IR Addy to kick in before he speaks
I'm going to watch Trump because apparently I enjoy suffering

Where is trump making his speech?
Gotta give props to all the get out the vote ads.
12k dropped in az
Am I gonna have to stay up late drinking for a 3rd night in a row or can I get a good night's sleep tonight?
Biden has Erie and is surging in Cumberland. Only a matter time before it’s all over
Lol Biden might sweep the Georgia-Pennsylvania duet at this rate. All while trump is gonna cry stop the count. You love to see it
PA gonna shift at any moment!
Candidates on Election Day concede when their odds are seemingly slim because they want to stay loyal to democracy?
[deleted]
This may be Trump's greatest news conference of all time. Ready for the meltdown.
at least AZ up 5% counting /s
They’re all turning to in fighting. Can see Wray and Esper fired soon. Jr is going after everyone. Who knows how unhinged Trump is going to be. Can he just be hinged for once?
"So is this gonna be a ""Fight Song"" moment or a ""Hey Man Nice Shot"" moment?"
Can Biden win GA? Betting is favoring him heavily?
Can we go back to the part where Rick Santorum isn’t on the screen pls
I love how we all seem to be watching Fox. They probably have their highest viewing figures ever among non-conservatives and I'm absolutely here for it.
How many lies will Trump tell at his speech?
Trump about to announce he is suing all Biden voters
LOL Kelly Anne cant help to contradict herself.
Trump just wants to say all the things that get fact-checked on social media.
There is no voter fraud
47 threads my God
[removed]
lol I hope I live long enough to see Kellyanne receive everything she deserves.
If Georga flips im getting a Falcons SnapBack.
President Trump will declare martial law and say our democracy is under attack by socialists and communists.
Is Santorum a masochist? Why would he go on CNN!!?!
I think we’ll be in thread 53 by the time Biden wins 👀 soon 👀
I don't wanna miss the moment Van Jones fucking body slams Santorum.
If Rick's face wasn't so annoying id almost feel bad for him

What a douche bag"
My mom doesn't even like Santorum
[I think Fox gave up...](https://i.imgur.com/kjqpaub.png)
CNN trying to match FOX with the arguments....ratings must have dropped lmao
People talking about Georgia senate going to a runoff. What does that mean in terms of who is likely to win?
Why is it that most of the people in these threads seem to be chill when posts that reach the front page are toxic as shit?

I can't wait to read the insider book about his downfall
"Can't wait till Trump tries to run in 2024 on the platform of pardoning the greatest president in history, possibly just Abe Lincoln has a slight edge since he wasn't a convicted felon."
"His posture will probably be poor, Blondie. He slouches."
GIVE US 48
These grifters in Arizona are so pathetic to listen to. Trying so hard to be relevant.
Of course this orange fuck is late.
Show me wich parts of my body are voting overwhelmingly for biden pleasee
Maybe he's finishing up signing some blank documents and he doesn't want to come out til Pence puts them up on the fridge
"I sort of hope this is like when the Von Trapp family was going to win the award, but they had already fled.  

Maybe Trump and his family of cretins can huff and puff their way over the mountain somewhere."
"Good news, Chatham releases results soon. 15k vote should reduce the gap to 2000 vote. By the end of tonight Georgia will be blue!"
I wonder if hes just losing his shit behind closed doors or is he about to concede? Is he about to mobilize militias?
"The danger with the AP's call is that, if they have to retract it and if Trump wins Arizona, that will add ammo to his claims/give fodder to his base that they are trying to steal this from him in as many ways possible. In this case, calling things prematurely.

We all better pray AP is right. Because it won't just be a minor mistake. The Trump team will absolutely use this."
"We all know the President has a casual relationship with the truth.

Lol"
here we go boys
The way he saws election makes my skin crawl
Wtf is this lol
This is going to be so fucking funny.
Wow. Holy shit right off the bat.
Is he actually reading this nonsense?
"Sure Donny, sounding a little desperate now."
What a start!
Man even he doesn't believe this shit
he lives in a fantasy land.
Where are you all watching the jackass speak?
holy fuck this guy is gonna go down in history as the biggest fucking crook/sham/asshat in America
Someone tranquilliser this fucker.
"Every time he speaks, I could just vomit."
"""Big Money"""
"""Historic margins in many states""

wow."
"so he won all the legal votes.

apparently he doesn't see to 70+ million that don't think so."
"Peak asshole here ladies and gentlemen, peak asshole."
"Trump comes on , I push the mute button."
Is it bad that it saddens me that somebody can be this fucking stupid?
This guy is so full of shit lmao.
I'm waiting for him to pull an executive order from his folder and say he's ordering all ballot counting to stop....
Welcome to my last game of Pigeon Chess.
He's so fucken delusional.
"Same with the fucking legal and illegal votes shit. He's super nervous too and saying there was no blue wave when biden is about to flip like 5 states
Smh. You know this shit of losing the election is going to consume him inside every day of life until he dies."
More fake news
"So the reps do well, its ""unsual"". Dems do well, ""cheating"". Uh huh."
They need to cut him off
“ The party of inclusion” excuse me sir
Trump is on xannies
"if the polls said there was going to be a blue wave, wouldn't that mean more democrats would stay at home...?"
What's the bet he's going to faint at the podium? I'll put 50 on it.
have you guys noticed the bots disappeared because the election is over? Where are all the MAGA hats now?
CNN is fueling this by continuing to air his speech. Do what MSNBC has done and don't even acknowledge it.
He sounds like he's gonna cry lol
Sleepy Donald has his eyes closed.
"This ""speech"" didn't last 10 seconds on MSNBC"
Holy fuck get to the point you slug
He's just straight up reading his speech lmaooo
Almost like polls don’t cause voter suppression
Trump: Everyone is winning but me
sleepy donald
Kwinny-PEE-yock
I adore the pettiness of this.
I feel like he’s definitely been drugged up
Of course polls mean you can't vote if they don't agree with you.
"If you were gonna use the polls to manipulate people into not voting... wouldn't you show them with their preferred candidate leading, not the other way around?"
This makes any chance of him having a concession speech very slim. He's going to go out flailing.
"Polls are a guess?
Also they had legal observers."
“Thighland is a wonderful country”
"Shut the fuck up, Donny"
Please take questions please! Haha
"Work smarter, not harder. Republicans should embrace mail-in voting."

"lmao he's completely unable to say ""losing"""
"fox news: trump: mail in ballots ""so one sided"""
Can't watch to watch the highlight reel of this after I get off work in a few minutes.
He's rambling... he's out of excuses
I love how many organizations stopped to fact check his lies. Not Fox News of course.
Sleepy don
Man it would be hilarious if biden took a state during this presser
LOL go to Philly and say that.
The balls on this idiot.
remember: he thought Obama wasn't a citizen.
Tremendous is like the only word this ghoul knows.
They're using binoculars to see in...but we're not insane!
Lol like it's just two people in a maintenance closet at the PA convention center stealing the election.  There absolutely are people watching.
He's trying to instigate his support to actually storm one of these counting stations and disrupt the counts
Damn so NBC not going back to Trump huh?
Days without being a national embarrassment: 0
I love the ZERO facts given
He's such a dangerous man to give a platform to. He believes this shit and it's scary.
Trump is so terribly weak

i don't think he's going to stop babbling. any bets for what time this ends?
"Drag his ass out once the vote is done. What a sore loser, lol."
"Is this going anywhere or not? I'm only watching because I was worried he was going to set the White House on fire or something, but I'd rather not have to listen to whatever *this* is for much longer..."
Yeah just like that laptop proof amirite
How long has this idiot been talking now?
Happening now: Trump hasn’t taken a single breath while he’s talked fearing the press will cut him off.
This is what a rich spoiled sore loser looks like.
You think if their were no pandemic he would still complain about votes?
Is this speech on a loop? I swear I heard the same points twice already
Shenanigans!
We shouldn't be letting a sundowning old man go on like this.
What kind of votes do you think they are counting in Arizona...? Hahah
I can't wait to hear Chris Cuomo's take on that sad speech lmao
That press conference was pathetic and he was scared to take questions. Coward.
I can't wait till he goes to prison and he's scheming against Jared for a job in the library.
"Wow! Shoutout to our frontline election workers! Thank you for risking life and limb to ensure a fair, honest, and accurate election!!! Congratulations! Take a bow!"
When do y'all think we'll know the winner of Georgia? My friends are bugging me to do something with them but I don't wanna miss anything.

Anybody have a link to CNN? I need some sexy Cooper in my life

"OK... Talk to me about the Senate please. So it's currently tied at 48-48? But if there's a runoff in GA in January, which is looking very likely, there are still one or two seats up for grabs? And even if it ends up tied a 50/50, the GOP can filibuster and hold up a bunch of of bills, not to mention Dems don't always vote in line. But most importantly, the Dems won't have enough of a cushion that we're long past any major reforms taking place in the next two years. Is this correct?"

Is this an attempt by a foreign actor to keep the country divided?"
"Trump supporters are showing up at counting locations in GA

Wtf? I missed 46!

"Whats up with everyone saying AOC 47?

I understand the 47th president, I thought maybe she made announcement or something about wanting to run in 2024"
FoxNews will declare Biden winner the second he takes the lead in PA.  Just because they want to be first.
Ok but why are we having new threads every hour?
[removed]
"Assuming he loses this election and ignoring he could run again: Who are the prospective Republican nominees for 2024? It'll be interesting to see who rises to the plate in each party, after the shenanigans we've seen the last 4 years."
Did the states just stop counting? It’s after 5pm and no updates today.
"Forgive my ignorance, but is there a runoff at in GA for the presidential race if neither candidate gets 50%? I keep hearing it mentioned for both senate seats, but nothing about the Presidency."
They should just call every state for Biden at this point.
These commercials will haunt me.
Y'all think Biden will win Georgia?
I wonder how many Trump voters are regretting their vote right now. I know his most fervent supporters will not bat an eyelash at his blatant attacks on democracy during this election. Are they willing to set their principles aside to support such an abhorrent man?
[deleted]
Watching loser trying to sue is kinda eyesore
Are they stopping the votes in PA? what am i missing on CNN?
Just give us some results! How the hell is it still taking so long!
PA SoS reminds me of the Finkle is Einhorn lady
John King is good with math.
After this is over im going to feel like Tom hanks after the Omaha beach scene in saving private Ryan
"I see the floor as Biden finishing up 90,000 in PA."
[deleted]
"> After all of Dems' fretting in the final week, there is still a possibility Biden could win Pennsylvania by a larger margin than Michigan or Wisconsin.

shut toomey up
Why are Republicans going on the offense so hard in PA instead of places that matter i.e NV and GA.
"Probaby catch DTJ on r/relationshipadvice saying his family gave so much in the GOP relationship but now everyone is ghosting them and they seem to not care anymore. His family treated them with the world and this is how they react

And then someone cross posts it to r/amitheasshole"
Toomey started out dissing Trumps supporters and quickly went into shenanigans going on in PA and how there's no confidence in the process.
"While Fox News is asking where Hunter is, I wanna know where Pete is.

He calms me."
Trump speaking in 38 mins.
"Trump going to speak at 6:30 

Can we do this 25th amendment shit now? How quick can we do that"
Trump going to incite a Civil War at 630
why is it this close? shouldn't be a doubt
Odds on trump being belligerent and just straight up dropping an N-bomb?
"That last drop wasn't Philly. Philadelphia still showing 86%. There's your 78,000 right there."
Come PA count those votes!
"Note: There are around 400k votes left in PA. 326k are mail in ballots not yet counted, but the rest are votes counted but not yet tallied, afaik

What are the chances violence breaks out and they can't finish counting?
"Who is this bald guy in Argo.

I know him from somewhere. 

I know his voice. 

I wanna figure it out without looking it up.. 

Was he in The Sopranos? 

Fuck it I'm going in.

Alan Arkin who the fuck is that.

GATTACA 

Definitely remember him in that. 

Gattaca is one of the best sci fi films of all time. 

Think I'll watch that next."
Still need like 14% from Philly county....
Why do we have to keep treating Republican voters nice when the leaders they choose at all levels are criminals and liars...... and if they are a decent human they lose their spine anytime they are needed. I'm tired of being nice to idiots and evil people.
Since the Def Sec is stepping down are we going to hear Trump enact the Insurrection Act at 6:30?
How funny would it be if Biden asks Jim Mattis to be SecDef again?
All I can say after all this: there has to be a better way.
Is Trump coming to concede?
How wild would it be if Biden won NV and PA and GA and lost AZ lol
"For people claiming there is a 0% chance that Trump will call for calm and peace in his speech: there is actually a *negative* 100% chance of this happening. That means that he would have to give a subsequent speech where he called for calm and peace, in order for there to be a 0% chance that Trump will call for calm and peace in this speech."
I find it interesting that news anchors refer to Trump as “president Trump” 100% of the times. Is that always the case?
Is it still looking good for Biden or does the orange shit stain speaking at 630pm become something to be concerned about?
"We need one of those catchphrase bingo boards like on Saturday night live.

The democrats are stealing the election

Proud boys, stand by stand ready

The most fraudulent election in history

Fake news

I have been the best president

I have done more for blacks than maybe Lincoln"
This could be bad.  Trump might throw a match on powder keg.

And the dump trump train is becoming overwhelming
"Joe Biden:  Just a few minutes ago, I got a very nice call from Donald Trump.  He congratulated me and our campaign, and conceded the race.


HAHAHA just kidding, I couldn't get through that with a straight face."
This is honestly sad to watch
68 mil voted for this fool
He is fucking incoherent. I think about the poor person who is tasked with handling this fucking idiot and how desperately they must have tried to talk him out of this dumbass speech.
They should call PA.
Where are people seeing the GA data?
"Per the state website, 250000 votes left in PA.

We good?"
"Nate Silver just called the AZ SOS the least transparent one in the remaining states.

He's right, she's truly awful

She's a Dem but seems to be way over her head"
[deleted]
"I think it's important to remember that Biden is winning more because of who he's running *against* than because of the candidate he is.  

He's a product of all the moderate dems giving up three days before super Tuesday in order to prevent Bernie from winning.  And given Trump's everything, he really should have a more concrete lead than he does.

I'm glad he's winning.   But the fact that he's received ""more votes than any other presidential candidate in history"" is more a reflection of how much dems hate Trump than his quality as a candidate."
"Joe Biden on inauguration day:

*""Get out of my office... Bake 'em away, Toys!""*"
How are californian magas doing? Yall really had 55 electorates shoved to biden
Any mentions of a certain video game whose title ends with the current thread number may result in a Secret Service interrogation.
"So, now that 46 is retired, who do we expect for 47?"
"Wow, TIL there is a state named Pennsylvania. What a funny name."
That press conference was scary. What the fuck.
[deleted]
Even if Biden takes the lead in PA today they are not calling it today
"So if we have no winner by Inauguration Day, does Pelosi become president until it’s decided?"
Who likes grindcore
Van Jones does interrupt him a lot though. So him saying he doesn’t is just a lie. But I don’t care because Van Jones is right.

So what exactly is going on in PA with the monitoring? Why did they (allegedly) go against the court order?

What county was the latest PA batch?
That's the press conference room isn't it? Not a room full of flags or anything. Of course everything happens on Nov. 5th.
Did Biden over or underperform in that Cumberland County dump we just had?

Do we have a shot at PA being called tonight?
How is NV looking?
"Trump will be delivering his speech from his new bunker in the Cayman Islands, so it might be running a little late as they get everything set up."
Are the PA mail in votes that came in after Nov 3 included in these counts or are they waiting to count them depending on courts?
If those Georgia cotes are really in Savannah then its pretty much a wrap. I can't see Trump going 2/2 with AZ + NV

Well it's all but called at this point. I'll check in around midnight to see what's up. ✌️

Frens how is Biden winning?"
Trump has this country by the balls. He'd rather see this country literally split in half than allow the transition of power. He'd rather die. He's already declared victory and will not budge. The vote counts are irrelevant. In his mind he has already been re-elected. The military won't force him out. And I don't have the confidence in the people to drag him out of the white house either. People will riot and burn for a few months before giving up and returning to normalcy.
"I’m honestly fine with voter fraud hurting Trump, even though there isn’t any.

The GOP suppresses far more votes anyways that it would be poetic that they lose because of dirty tactics."

"Georgia lead is 9,535 with estimated 43k ballots left to be released. Biden needs 60% of the remaining and he is averaging at nearly 70% so far. We've got GA in the bag. PA is even more of a done deal: 90k Trump lead, 430k ballots left, Biden needs 60% of the remaining ballots to win PA and he is averaging 70-80% in most recent vote ballot dump. Trump is just barely maintaining the 57% margin in AZ needed to flip the state, but he has literally no wiggle room and that margin is likely to diminish as we get more ballot drops from the more democrat counties that are left. NV is looking very good for Biden, Nate Silver says it's already a call for Biden at this point, as 90% of the remaining votes come from heavily democratic Clark County and Biden is already leading the state with a healthy margin. We only need PA to seal this win but my honest prediction is that we take them all: GA, PA, NV, and AZ. Biden wins with 306 and there's no chance Trump is contesting that."

Non US here. What's the go with GA? Does anyone know when that is expected to be called?

Bannon you mean?
"Fellas, how many votes do we have left in GA to count?"
Who got up in east coast just to check the result! And who is still up in west coast!

"Well of course, some of those people are worth more because they have fewer neighbors."
USA is a comedy
Everything we are taught when we were kids is basically a joke. We were always taught decisions should be made when the majority rule. Except apparently our government 🙄
"To be fair, I’m all for abolishing the EC, but the campaigns were run with the EC in mind. The winner is whoever wins a majority of those points, not the majority of the votes. I’m not saying Trump could narrow that margin or Biden couldn’t expand on it, but they didn’t run national races. They ran 50 something state races"
The real comedy is that it's this close at all.
"Wow, wasn't expecting that!"
"Hell yeah, I live there and it was only a matter of time."
Holy shit we did it!
"[It's mainly Philadelphia where Biden is at over 80%.](https://i.imgur.com/Vm6ck7c.png)

Philly REALLY REALLY does not like Trump. Only cities like San francisco's do even better then 80% Biden. 

Still 85K votes to come from Philly and 8/10 of them will be for Biden. 

In a couple of hours the difference will be less then 50K."

"Many many Philadelphia votes still outstanding, those lean very heavily D."
"I remember 8 years ago when I went to bed on November 3rd, distraught that there was a good chance that Biden was going to lose. Yesterday morning, I woke up to Biden down 660,000 votes. The needle slowly but surely moving in his direction has been very satisfying."
"At 11:30pm pacific on election night I was pretty comfortable with PA going blue — at that time 0.8m absentee ballots were counted out of 3.1m requested, with 78% of those 0.8m going to Biden. Trump was at 2.9m and Biden at 2.2m. Just had to wait it out."
Can you imagine if we counted mail in first though
"Was at like 400,000 with 82% reported. 90,000 with 89% reported.

Trump claimed victory in Pennsylvania on election night lmaooo"
"IT’S OVER 9,000!!!!

(Biden goes super saiyan)"
[deleted]
100k?
That was the plan. First disrupt the mail service. Then start saying mail in ballots are not to be trusted. Then get key states to force mail in ballots to be counted last. Simmer for 24 hours and yell “corruption!” when those votes are counted last.
"While simultaneously yelling, ""We can't have an election where we don't know the results for weeks!"""
It's the GOP way!
"If it weren’t for cognitive dissonance, the GOP wouldn’t have any cognition at all"
They'll be 2 runoffs in Georgia in January so it's not over yet!

Stacy Abrams is a national treasure!
Just think how (not) close it would have been if hundreds of thousands of voters hadn't been wrongly stripped from the rolls. Y'all need to get your house in order down there.
Abrams is the hero we all need but don’t deserve.
This isn't really something to be proud of. Embarassing rather.
I laughed out loud at this
And the deficit.
"Good, maybe their viewers will start to think the same and wear masks"
"Tucker Carlson on January 21st - ""The Democrats and Biden are letting Americans die!"""
"Just got an AP News alert saying that in areas of the country where COVID-19 is most rampant now, Trump enjoyed the strongest support.

If that isn't a metaphor for this country, I don't know what is…"
and the federal deficit of $3 trillion.
You mean the anti-mask movement will be unmasked?
Nah theeir supporters said that it'll be done after November 3rd
You know what? Fine. Then we can stop hundreds of thousands from dying. If that's what it takes.
I saw *four* people getting swabbed at Kroger today.
this
"Use their words against them, over and over and over again. Never forget."
and blames Biden for it
"If he just kept his fucking mouth shut and let Fauci and Birx handle the pandemic, he definitely would've been re-elected."
He might’ve even got the popular vote and the House.
"I absolutely thought (feared) Trump, a known germaphobe, would come out strong against the pandemic, while simultaneously stirring up nationalism against China, and would have a cakewalk to re-election. Instead he did literally everything wrong. Even his attacks against China were half assed. His absolute incompetence on this issue cost him bigly. 

That being said, I’d trade Biden winning and endure four more years of Trump if it would get back the quarter million and counting American lives lost."
"Typically presidents do well in times of crisis, the fact that trump has lost this shows just how much of a failure he is.

If he gave even the *slightest* fuck about covid, his stupid ass would've been undoubtedly blasted into presidency again"
"Can't fight a disease you faked having for last minute sympathy votes. Think about it. A man who fits 2 high risk cartegories: age and weight, needs oxygen therapy more than once, and beats it in a few days? I bet the percent of total infections includes less than 1% of cases that fit this. How do we all sit here and talk our (truthful) shit about trump and his lies, yet nobody has the balls to call out one of the most blatant ones in order to try and scrape sympathy votes? Oh and 2 days after deciding that acting like a 3 year old toddler whose twin took their half of the cookie? Yeah no."
"Effort is there, but not the strategy or execution."
Your right
"That's the thing with fascists. They have to live in their own bubble with its own rules. As long as there are enough people with the feets on the ground then they will eventually lose.

At what cost varies."
"It's not likely, he would've gotten re-elected."
"Yeah, but you're failing to see what their long term strategy was here; 

1. Keep the COVID threat around so that people would want to vote by mail. (I mean when you think about it, why else would they want to drag this COVID shit out as long as possible like they are? It's completely counter to the supposed goal of restoring the economy)
2. Work day and night to convince your constituency that said COVID was a hoax or non-issue, so that only *democrats* would want to vote by mail.
3. Sabotage the USPS to slow mail down and cause uncertainty about the safety of mail-in voting (and even admit to as much). 
4. Warn endlessly about vague ""voter fraud"" perpetrated by the mysterious ""they"", who seem to exist at all levels of government and media at all locations across the country. 
5. dispute the shit out of mail-in ballots at every turn hoping to invalidate as many as possible because they're primarily going to be democrat. Also, try to act like the mail-in ballots being primarily democrat is some type of voter fraud conspiracy, when the reality is that your entire plan was for them to mostly be democrat. 

IE they engaged in a months long plan to isolate more democratic voters to mail-ins, because they would have a much easier time disputing/invalidating the mail-in ballots and/or portraying it as some type of conspiracy."
Congrats on first!
">If Trump fought covid like he has these election results

Who would he sue over covid case numbers tho? Fauci?"
You’re 100% right. Honestly all trump needed for re Election was to say listen to dr Fauci and everyone go wear masks. If he took it seriously from February he wins this election
This is definitely in character. Trump is all about the self-own. The man can't even profitably run a casino for chrissakes.
You would think that the signs in Russian might give it away

"""Roberts County is one of six prohibition, or entirely dry, counties in the state of Texas.""
According to wikipedia. Definitely not everyone's cup of tea to say the least"
Find the county that only (or primarily) votes for a third party this election. They would be the second worst.
Surprised it wasn’t in my state of Tennessee.
Damn. There goes my plans to move there.
"Ah, a shithole count~~r~~y."
Probably just one family
Now do highest for Biden.
"I expected it to be in Oklahoma, this is a great shock! Excellent work!"

Dry county too. Sounds horrid.
"Trump supporters may support an asshole, but that doesn't mean they can't be spoken to like people. Don't put too much stock in how they voted to reflect their actual personalities. If you start to hate those with different political beliefs, you'll always be angry.

And fuck Donald Trump."
"Had to look this place up and it's exactly what I expected. It's a West Texas, pan handle county that's entirely farm land. This part of America is as red as it gets as it's so underdeveloped and almost entirely white.  It would not surprise me if this is also a dry county as well."
Do you have the data stored somewhere or was it all manual? I'm curious as to what the highest trump % was among counties with over say 10k people
"PA is all but a certainty for Biden, same with NV.

I really, really want Biden to take AZ and GA though. It would be nice to flip some red states."

Remember when his campaign manager announced unprompted that he is alive and well.
Dana Bash on CNN reported he is down and depressed and starting to see the writing on the wall lol
"But he is, according to some guy's twitter, alive and well."
I want to see him so bad. Orange ass
For once I just wanna see his sad ugly face
"Can we just hit the pause button for like a couple of years, please?"
He’s having a temper tantrum
"Probably locked into the residence, not allowed to leave at all.  I'd imagine Trump just wants to grab all the attention for an hour or two, but his staff knows it would be the death of them and the campaign."
Suicide watch
Like a tick...buried in deeeep.
"Literally every state is the same, rural = red, big cities = blue. Anyone generalizing a state is just as ignorant"
Atlanta has a ton of west coast transplants due to the film industry right? And a killer LGBT scene. It’s a hip town.
"Big cities have progressives, that’s not exactly surprising.  Hell, Alabama even has them in Birmingham.  Mississippi even has a few on the gulf coast and Jackson."
Basically we just need to build a ton of cities in the South.
"Yup, most areas of Atlanta (not Buckhead/Tuxedo Park) and Decatur are extremely progressive"
"Plus, we're getting lots of people here recently due to the film industry, and many of them are pro-union liberals."
"The divide is not really by state. Every state has its red and blue areas. In Georgia (and elsewhere) the cities are deep blue. Even SC has blue cities. But then in NY, upstate is red. Western Mass is red too. Etc"
"Yeah, the North/South and Coast/Flyover divides are pretty illusory. The real difference is Urban/Rural and there are a large number of urban Southerners who are plenty progressive."
and the B52s!
I’ve never been to Georgia but it seems like more people are moving there in the past four years. I’m not surprised it’s close
"Stalin too, thats about as left as you get!

absolutely
Don't forget Philly yo
We need to put up at statue honoring the black voters who came through for us I. Place of some of thos racist old slave owners that got taken down!
Yup! And Philly!
"You're welcome.

\[even though I'm in IN\]"
Hey! Im a white Republican in ATL that voted Biden. Come on shower me in thanks too
"White voters still overwhelmingly went to Trump. 

I will be the first to admit I live in a bubble. Almost all of my neighbors, friends, coworkers, etc despise Trump. It seemed like to me only a fringe group would support him. Nope. Half of America."

They usually do
PA looks easy given that 78% of all the incoming votes are for Biden.
"5:02 EST Trump is down to about 90,500 lead in PA. Seems like we're getting a steady stream of results that favor Biden."
GA is looking good at this last rate
The margin of third party voters in Georgia is just sad. This was not the year for a protest vote. Fuck Shit Shitenson.
"Does anyone have a graph of the change in vote share in Georgia with the percent counted on the X axis and the percentage of the vote on the Y?

I calculated the remaining Georgian votes to be 99,258 (4,863,661 votes counted or 98%)"
Is it possible any of these states will be called today or will we have to wait until tomorrow?
I think Biden will win them all except for North Carolina.
"Can you explain why I've seen the remaining votes estimated at 340,000? Seems like it would make a big difference."
[deleted]
He always seemed like a rational person all the times Jon Stewart had him on.
"The sad thing is, the guy in that video was terrified of an Obama presidency. After 8 years, nothing happened. Yet, he was then terrified of a Hillary presidency. And now he's terrified of a Biden presidency. These idiots never learn."
"It hurts to see a kind, considerate candidate like McCain and know we’ll never have anyone like that again running for president"
"His reaction when that man said he's scared says it all. Fox News and the RNC have scared the shit out of these people, and scared is never far from violent if pushed too hard. Trump pushed it too hard.

America lost a good man in him."
"McCain was a legitimately good person who went through unimaginable shit for his country and it’s people. I would not mind having a republican leader if it was a man like McCain. Unfortunately, a man of his stature will likely never be seen in the GOP again."
"I love the video where Obama delivers an eulogy for McCain. That moment where he talks of him getting the last laugh, the camera cutting to Bush struggling to contain his laughter.

Will Trump even have that kind of relationship to politicians from his *own* party?"
"Just to add to your comment, [watch](https://youtu.be/NvgqRKYapU8) McCain's concession speech. 


It'll be a long time before another Republican presidential candidate will be as articulate in defeat."
Sarah Palin was the prototype for trump. She was the appetizer. McCain was the one who gave that piece of shit woman a national platform.
I've never seen this video but I wanted to personally thank you for sharing it.
McCain actually had a backbone. He was the last Republican who had a brain.
Because McCain didn't take shit like the others. Trump was also incredibly shitty to Cruz as well. The difference between McCain though is he didn't put his party before even his own wife.
So he never actually cared about the healthcare debate and only ended up siding with the democrats to spite Trump. Look McCain was a war monging piece of shit. Fuck John McCain
"While I hate to dick on McCain here, and I respect what he says, it's amazing to me as someone outside the US that when challenged with the notion that Obama may be an Arab, his response is ""no he isn't"". As if it would be a problem if he was. I can see that's not the place to challenge this woman's xenophobia but seriously, America (and the republican party in particular) appears stuck in this small minded rut."
GOP will distance themselves from that
Super great heading into two potential runoffs in GA. Theyre not going to put in any effort and may actively try to hurt GOP chances
"What is dead may never die. We thought we saw the GOP explode and lose their identity after Obama's two wins, and look what happened in 2016."
"Good lord imagine all the red states breaking out into a civil war, how do you even stop that?"

This is fantastic!! Thank you so much. I actually can't believe how stress relieving it is.
Thats fun. Thanks!

Needed that. Thanks.
This is amazing lol
I did need that!
Neat
This was strangely satisfying. Thank you.
Nice! I popped them all
That's so clever. Thank you.

Love it!! Thanks :)
Next time make it mine sweeper.
Haha that surprise one was funny.  Good trick.

I don't like this e-bubble wrap un-popping.

I was hoping for an Easter egg somewhere in there.

"I'm on a 3rd party app (rif) that uncovers all the spoiler tags at once.

Well that was fun. Cheers!
"I'm using the reddit is fun app, when I clicked they all popped at once 😕"
That was fun and very satisfying and I love everything about this. You're the best!
Omg I love this. People are totally going to steal this and post it all over reddit
I needed this more than I realized. Literally dumb tears in my eyes and a big dumb grin on my face. Thank you.

It's going to be insanely close. Talk about every vote counting.
Right on track!
Thanks for the stats friend
And even then it won’t be set in stone because recounts recounts recounts
Any idea how he’s been trending in GA?
Thank you!
Good thing he’ll be dead or in prison
Watching his bloated elderly orange corpse attempt to campaign in four years is going to be fucking hilarious. He's going to completely destroy the GOP if he tries. Do it Donald.
At least we know he is admitting to failure and won’t refuse to move out of the White House...
"Is that a concession of defeat?

(Probably not, in his mind he *can* run for three terms.)"
Can you run from a jail cell? Or from Russia?
I don’t have the mental capacity to even think about another trump campaign
">Resurectuon run

jesus this man has no shame in manipulating evangelicals and they’re too stupid to see it"
Well he’s in the bargaining stage it looks like
God I hope so. And I hope AOC runs on the Dem side.
"If he's really saying that, then he knows he lost."
"Good, will love to see me fail again"
Lmao get him off Twitter and there goes his platform
Hm idk laws or anything but can you run a presidential campaign from federal prison?
How is he going to do that from jail?
I don't think convicted felons are eligible for office.
And without a Senate to actually make progress he’ll probably win.
"Awesome. A chance to show the world we reject Trumpism, *twice*!"
Is that even legal?
He'll be dead or in prison by then
From where? Moscow or from a jail cell?
Gonna be fucken tough to run when his assets have all been claimed by the govt.
With the amount of legal troubles headed his way if he loses this election. I think running again will be the last thing on his mind.
"Lol, he's already coming across as senile, another 4 years won't help."
I bet Trump's handlers don't trust him not to be EXTRA insane at an in-person press briefing right now.

NV would already be called if it weren’t the clinching state. But AP might do it anyway.
You think they can finish counting today?
Nice
"That means Biden's lead in Nevada should improve by around 15,000 votes."

she's a red wine drinker for sure

Fr tho
"Isn't it crazy that I'm so wrapped up in getting Biden to win, I am totally forgetting about this historical VP? Thanks for the reminder."
[deleted]
Correct
yes because he'll have 273 votes
"Yeah if he over takes and keeps the lead, thats game"
Yep
Correct
"If he does, yes."
Yes
Correct.
Yes
I bet everyone will call it immediately
Yup!
"Yes. Realistically it's already game over. News orgs just don't want to call PA before Biden formally takes the lead, even though they know he's going to win the state."
"I think Nevada still matters tho.It's a Hillary state,he needs the 3 rust belt states and all the Hillary states."
Right
Yes!
If he does then yes
Yup
correct.
"correct, but slight correction from ""overtakes"" to ""gets more votes and wins the state"""
Correct
"Once it's a Tie, fox news will call it for Biden"
Yes if Biden wins PA it’s over even if he loses the other states including Arizona
Yes it's game over
yep
Correct PA would give him 273 and the win.
Yes. PA is enough.
"Yes, Biden only needs one state."
Yep
"PA seems so close it will be contested in court. Until the recount is done, it's not final."
Co-rrect
"yupp, obviously those states would be really nice, tho NC I am pretty sure will go fro trump"
essentially barring something incredibly dumb happening
yep
Yes
"Correct, if Biden wins PA it's over."
That is correct. Without Arizona Biden is at 253 and the 20 from PA pushes him above 270 (273)
Correct.
Yes
Correct. If Biden wins PA it's over. Doesn't mean he has to win it. But Trump can't win without it.
Correct
"Yup. 

If he takes either PA or GA, it's over. If not, he needs to win AZ and NV."
Correct!
That is right.
"Yes, that'll put Biden past 270."
"Correct, but it's likely that GA gets called first, and if that happens and AZ stays consistent then it's also over"
PA alone gets him across the line
"Yep. The election will be called at that point. 

In theory, it could be called now because Trump has no real path to victory in NV and some places have called AZ already, but I think a lot of those outlets don’t want to admit that they called AZ prematurely and don’t want to call the entire election yet."
Yep
Basically game over yes.  There will likely be a recount called if it's too close though.
"Pretty much yes.  Not sure how much Biden will be over Trump, but there's always provisional ballots and such that will be counted later.  

But yeah if Biden wins PA then its over and we don't have to give two shits about NV or AZ.  Although the more the merrier"
yup
Yes. However the more states he gains in addition makes it harder for Trump to contest the results
Biden wins PA and it’s game over. Biden wins GA and it’s basically over. Matter of fact is that Trump has to win 4 out of 5 states to win. Biden only has to win 1 or 2 depending which state is it.
I believe so.
"Correct, but if Biden gets other states it gives padding to defend against Trump’s recounts."
"It seems like it should be. If Biden comes ahead in the count while there are still a lot of uncounted ballots, I think it gets called for Biden. If he comes ahead with almost all the ballots counted, they might have to wait to call it."
Yep
"Correct.

Arizona has been called for Biden and is tallied into his vote count.  However, since Arizona only has 11 EV, and PA has 20 EV, losing AZ and winning PA would be a net +9 for Biden, which pushes him to 273.  If either candidate reaches 270 or higher, they win full stop.

There are processes that still have to occur such as validating results which won't happen for another 20 days (IIRC), and then the EC itself actually has to vote.  The likelihood of either of these 2 things flipping the results as they over the next few days are pretty close to 0."
Yes
Might be afraid for the safety of counters as well. I hope they let them leave before announcing anything.
"Read my comments

Slow and right is better than fast and wrong"
"I read something last night that WI recounted twice just to be sure, and only found discrepancies of around 110 and 130 respectively."
I wonder if nobody wants to be the state to end the election and have Trump and his dipshit followers ignite their bullshit on them
That and mail-in ballots require more manual handling.
Please let Fox be the first organization to call it. Trump’s meltdown will be epic lol!
That’s in 3 minutes
Eastern time?
"Stop the votes AND count the votes at the same time !!!! That's totally going to work!

"Eric trump putting up a hotline for ""voter fraud"" information. I don't think that will turn out the way he wants."
And by “flip the fuck out” he means commit acts of domestic terrorism at my bidding.
Not just the students or faculty there either. Athens is nice and blue on it's own.
"Speaking as a UGA student, Clarke County loves to fuck over students living on campus when it comes to voting so it is a big relief to hear we still ran blue that strongly lol"
"Proud alum here, threw a vote hillarys way when I lived there!"
Go Dawgs!
Uga!
Is that what he was talking about when he said something about possibly arresting that person after they were done with the vote counts?
"Yep, there's that classic projection. But as for Nevada vote counting, does that mean basically we can rule out Nevada from being called until the 12th?"
"Plus he's ahead in AZ and NV which those two alone get him to 270. But yeah, PA and GA are flipping. GA will flip tonight."
The last two dumps weren't quite as good for Joe.  Georgia may be decided by a few hundred votes.
Beautiful!
But there are two different numbers floating around for the amount of votes not yet reported.  Who do we believe?
Bwah
That Trump ain't right
Holy fuck King of Hill reference 😅 wish Judge would make a episode out of this.
Georgia's got a narrow urettie. Got them from his mother's side.
You know Dale is out looking for hunters laptop
"No one will call PA while the current tally and the trend disagree. 

Once the tally shows Biden, and the trend favors Biden, you'll see them call it."
if he wins PA then Biden wins even if AZ flips. But I think that they're going to be very gun-shy of calling NV before they're sure about AZ
Calling anything right now is risky since it would put Biden over 270 pushing them to call the election. (Assuming Biden wins the called state)
"There’s no incentive to be the first to call it. Even once every vote has been counted, Trump will contest it if he isn’t the winner. There is no drive to start instigating a concession or move on. We’re going to be talking about the “real” winner for weeks. This is just a prelude."
They could call both NV and PA then. Trump has no path in either of those states.

This is my favorite comment of this entire election cycle.
I spit coke zero through my nose laughing at this. Thank you friend.
Now that’s a name I haven’t heard in some time
Fuck Ajit
Is he gone if Biden is elected?
Lol where did this come from?
Fuck A Shit Pie
"Ah this was good to see.

Fuck Ajit Pai."
Good! Use your aggressive feelings. Let the hate flow through you.
Fuck Ellen Pao
"If that happens and a new president isn't seated, Pelosi becomes president.

They dum."
Do they not know that at some point Pelosi assumes the role?
"Wow, he looks like absolute shit."
This guy is a disgraced fascist wannabe
honest question: what happens then?
The Electoral College will vote on December 14th regardless of whether or not every single state has conclusive election results. Any state that didn't just wouldn't send electors.
Holy fuck.
He comes off as absolutely insane in this clip.
"This is Steve Bannon, one of Trump's top surrogates, publicly advocating for not only Republicans to steal the election, but also that Trump is the Chief Magistrate with sovereignty to ""fire"" members of Congress and prosecute people unilaterally.

Last time I checked, that was called a King.

This man is insane."
That is some crazy shit
That is fucking treasonous.
"They act like they're so smart but they forget that without an EC vote that doesn't mean Trump stays president, we just go down the line of succession."
You know what’s sad? I opened it to see if he really tweeted that
Build Best
">The only real mess may come with whatever Trump does when it's clear that he has lost the count.

He's already started causing a ruckus and it isn't even clear which way the final count will go. His supporters are already gathering to chant ""Stop the count!"" or ""Count them all"" depending on which state.   
And let's not even get into the fact that the Post Office openly defied court orders to check for every ballot before making their final delivery. We should fully expect thousands of ballots to be ""too late"" to be counted simply because postal workers didn't bother delivering them, because the postmaster general told them not to.  
So I'd say it's a bit messy."
"If by ""without incident"" you mean waiting in line for hours on end to cast votes in person, then, o.k."
">In most modern elections, we've been able to call the winner pretty quickly because it either, isn't that close on a state-by-state level or only comes down to 1 state fairly early in the process.

Little bit of that. Little bit of sheer volume of mail-in ballots."
"The only shitshow is the 69 million Americans licking the boots of a fascist, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, violence-inciting, baby-separating, lying, cheating, fraudulent scumbag making the race this close.

The election process itself has been working mostly smoothly, if not slowly. Wretched on my anxiety having to wait, but I want it done right."
"Yeah honestly, most of the drama that i see is just a byproduct of watching constant news reporting. Things like Virginia ending up blue is completely expected and doesnt make anyone bat an eye, but if you were watching minute by minute vote updates and predictions it seemed like the apocalypse"
But my emotions have been messy.

Seriously. If anybody gets hurt because of that diseased ballsack his ass should get thrown in jail as if he were any other citizen.

"If the SCOTUS steals the election there will be civil unrest the likes of which have never been seen in this country. I hope they firmly reject any notion of messing with the election, and frankly I would be surprised if they do as their 6-3 majority doesn't need the orange toddler to do damage."
such assholes.
Exactly as we expected. Fuck these craven grifters.
Jesus Chris. So will the Supreme Court get involved? What would have to happen for them to?
Terrifying if it happens but has almost no road to actually happening
Honestly that kind of stupid machismo power move might actually get some right wing idiots on his side.

"People fretting about PA are being silly. NV, PA and AZ all go to Biden. This should shut down any attempts to change the result."
"So he's losing the votes they are counting now 3 - 1?

Seems like a slam dunk for Biden"
"Oh, that's gonna be real close if the pattern continued."
Thats good. The first number went down by over half and the second went down by less than half.
"The effort GA has shown is amazing. Please keep this trend up. The more voices from that state, the better."

We believe in you!
"That's ok, you guys can still get us the Senate."
"Ngl, it would be a surprise.

But a welcome one to be sure :)"
I also want GA to be the tipping point and end this nightmare.   I think there is some politics behind releasing the last 40k votes.
"Proud of you, Georgia"
You guys did amazing.
"It would be a fitting end for all the bullshit that has happen that democratic voters face in that state. 

I want it to be the tipping point as well too."
wow haha
"This thread no, the last thread almost double the comments than the votes biden trails by"
I wouldn’t be surprised tbh
Yes
So the SCOTUS could still be on the menu.
"Everyone better turn out for those races. Like seriously. Trump is going to be sinking GOP since they're not rescuing him, but it's still GA."
Fuck yes
Georgie's gonna be crazy until January.
Dems would have to dump every bit of resources that they have at their disposal because those usually go towards the GOP.
Wait so there’s a chance e senate will be half and half? Isn’t that good news if it does lead to that?
It's going to be interesting if this is a runoff - I would imagine Trump taking his ball and going home - so Perdue and Loeffler will be going at it alone. Just need to get the turnout up some more for Jon and the Rev.
"If it goes to a runoff Biden, Obama, fucking everyone better be down in Georgia campaigning"
Nothing to celebrate yet but I’m hoping.
"Somehow I think the Trump fanbase won't simply go to bed and cry after the defeat. There'll be a lot of violence, sadly. I wouldn't party too much out in the open."

It's hilarious when Fox News called Arizona first f or Biden   Before any other network did
Perhaps there's less money to be made in a fascist dictatorship. Gotta keep the investors happy.
part of me wonders if that was intentional
There’s a reason he’s been going after Fox hard the last couple months. Murdoch must have informed him that the Fox Rat would be jumping ship.
Nice. Perdue won't escape Ossoff again
"Ossoff deserves to win.   Also,  FUCK Chuck Todd"
"The silent majority thing has always been some absurd propaganda because conservatives hate loud counterculture, but it’s patently absurd when you can’t win the popular vote."
Everything is the opposite of what they claim.  Like clockwork.
They were the silent minority last election. Now they’re the obnoxiously loud minority.
They were a minority of the population even in 2016
"That would be amazing. ""No blue states. No red states. ONLY ORANGE."""
That would require a very long memory; I doubt it.
This would actually be awesome. Let him have his own party. Take all the extreme right wing folks with him.
This is what I'm thinking. Its going to be really interesting to see where the GOP party goes from here

"not fair to bring the banana republic into this. while they might have overpriced shirts, their clearance is still pretty good."
It's baffling to me how he can use the term banana republic without any sense of irony.
Watch them do that then it comes back the Trump Administration was doing all the fraud.
Don Jr truly is the dumbest Trump.
"lol -""cleaning things up"" is acting exactly LIKE a 'banana republic'."
"Yeah. It is disgraceful. They have fuck all evidence to date. 

I mean, if the courts end up disenfranchising vast swathes of voters and putting Trump in office, let me tell you, the world will view the US as a failed state. Your electoral college pish is already wildly anti democratic...."
“Stop merely looking like a banana republic and start being one!”
"And you know this is Trump's plan when you consider Jr is the reasonable one, relatviely speaking."
"Instead of war what if, and I know this is a fucking crazy idea but bear with me, he just brought proof of this fraud to court when they heard his election fraud cases? Because he keeps going to court with no proof..."
Haha banana republic? Does he know what that means?
He's averaging 72% just to be fair.

at least they keeping it real about the fraud
"its not nevada at fault, its the post office. nevada could probably be done by now but there could still be ballots in the mail and they just have to wait"
I think he's averaging 78%.
"Philadelphia is averaging much higher and still has 86k votes to be reported. Philadelphia is averaging 80/20 for Biden, so Biden should close the margin by +52,000 just from Philly. That leaves about a 38,000 vote gap for the remaining votes."
"Even worse, total war.  As in the totality of the nation dedicated to the purpose.  Not just some fighting at the front, but complete sacrifice, be it our lives, time, energy, you name it."

Just throw the fucking US out at that point. The party of law and order and patriots and freedom and democracy lovers are the biggest subverters.
Should anyone explain to them that a SC case requires lower courts?
"Notice there's no legal argument.  Just the statement that Trump appointed these Justices (with the implication that they owe him) and that they need to just ""step in and do something""."
And trump speaks in roughly 30 minutes. It’s about to get bananas.
Sounds like he expects them to storm into a polling place
"How the fuck is it okay to say something like that openly?

Courts are supposed to be independent, even slightly hinting at the fact that they might work for the interests of a party/the goverment would be a big no no here. Not only thinking this, but saying it out loud in the public is a giant red flag.

And how can you ask the court to 'do something' without even saying **why** they would have to step in?"

Gah. I so badly want to feel good about this but I’m just too jittery. It’s not over until it’s over to my brain.
He's easily on track to do so: https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html
Given that upwards of 30% of those will be from Philly. This is looking VERY good.
"By my quick math that means he needs about 209k votes or 64% to win it. 

330-90=240
(90+121)/330=.64

Would win by 1000 votes"
He needs ~63% of the votes remaining. Is this doable?\
He's been getting 70-80%
"Down to 78k, 314k left"
A runoff with no Donald Trump on the ballot. Both seats will be absolutely critical AND winnable
Hell yes! Georgia is about to be bombarded for the next 60 days.
It will be recount and then runoff.
"This sounds more like the percentage of mail-in ballots that were sent out and that subsequently were returned.

I would seriously doubt that only 60% of returned ballots in PA actually made it back to be counted."
source?
Those ballots need to be counted. This is fucking ridiculous.
I’ve been looking but can’t find any sources for the delivery rates. Where did you find these?
That fucker needs to be charged and tried.
How is he not being lynched right now? The reason why the GOP keeps making ground is because there is no pushback.

Where?
Nice
7% but yeah
"Best hope GA pays attention to what Trump and his Toadies do over the next 2 months, we're going to need to majorly GOTV if we want to have a chance to win 2 senate seats at the same time in GA."
There is going to be an obscene amount of money spent in the state of Georgia during the next couple of months.
At least there is a chance. Even getting it to a tie would be amazing.
The votes that went to the two republicans will combine for the one republican. Perdue wins that by 20 points.
For real real? Not for play play?
"Runoff is a chance. Not a very good chance... at all, but it's a chance. Winning party typically does worse in midterms. Dems typically do worse in midterms.

We will see if Dems can get it up in GA in January."

Thank you for doing all the hard work! It's all about the effort! :)
The PA vote remaining seems high compared to what others are saying no?
Are they gluten-free?
I’ll take one of everything
There are 32 paths for either candidate to win. 27 of them lean Biden.
PA or any other two!
Hopefully we get all of them.
I’ll take everything on the menu
"And NV and PA are looking really solid, so..."
this is the only useful comment in all 47 threads
I think I'll splurge and order all four

Now Biden just needs either AZ, PA, or GA. Just one, and it's over."
"Hey, my buddy Biden would like the landslide combo."
"ope, and a side ranch please

How about all of those!
Down to 9K in GA. It'll be game over once Trump loses there.
"Biden has options, Trump has very few."

"You just found out America is full of morons?

Social media has fucked us all in the West. There are so many bad actors out there peddling conspiracy nonsense to the most vulnerable and easily-led. It could be our downfall. But remember, we're in it together."

But that's what Trump did for the past 1461 days.
Pot calling the kettle black...
You mean Nazi Barbie with her cross accessory.
yeahhhh too bad she will crawl over to one of the conservative media platforms and continue on until she latches on to another neo-fascist.

"This little maneuver is gonna cost us 52 years 

-Nevada, probably"
I'd really like to know the diff between votes to be counted vs votes to be reported. Apparently 450k to be reported vs 325k to be counted if im getting PA right? It's unclear and has a giant effect on what Biden needs
"What’s the odds he gives the most divisive, democracy damaging speech in the history of mankind instead?"
He's about to be former POTUS though I'll never recognize him as president ever.
And the rival campaign is being more presidential and he hasnt even won yet.
And that's why he lost
"No kidding.  How amazing would it be if he just took the stage and said something like ""everybody needs to relax and trust the system.  This is democracy in action and it's a good and beautiful thing.""

But no, he doesn't have a civil bone in his body.  This will absolutely be a speech about how he's being robbed and the votes need to stop being counted.  Probably some conspiracy theory shit thrown in there too about votes magically appearing."
"get rid of the electoral college and see voter participation skyrocket. As it is, not all votes are equal"
Compulsory. Voting.
No. This shit show right now is a great reason not reinforce the vote on 2022. Also promote down ballot voting
I expect a mad-dash to suppress these future votes considering how close this has currently gotten
"nope.  and every. election. in. between.  


presidential elections are the icing on the cake.  Vote in your local and state elections every single time."
"Sadly, we're close to 80% of eligible voters this time. There's really, truely just THAT many selfish, heartless, rascist people in the US."
Runoff time?
"Realistically, does anyone with more knowledge on the situation know if Dems have a solid shot at both Georgia seats in the event of two runoffs? 

I hear trump being off the ticket may be enough to tip the scales in Dems favor. 

Control of the senate would be HUGE."
[deleted]
YES!  That means it's a runoff election!!!!  Two senate seats are officially up for grabs in GA come Jan 5th!
Regardless of the presidential outcome. This is massive. Two potential seat flips in GA would retake the Senate if Biden wins the presidency (kamala tie breaker)
this made me lol
"its gonna take a lot more than tonight to weed out this cancer. time to start shaming people for being fucking morons. ""high road"" doesnt cut it when the world is a ticking time bomb, in so many ways"
It isnt. We still have 40% of the country that is straight bonkers
Biden needs to win by about 9K to avoid military ballots bringing it back for trump (if at all)
"Biden is 9 points ahead of where he needs to be in GA. 12 points ahead in PA.

For comparison Trump is 1 point ahead in average returns from what he actually needs. Trump has no room for error in AZ."
where is this raw data posted?  having to dig through news sites to piece together the story would love to know where the real data is coming from...
"So with this trend Biden should win with around 8000 votes (43645 * 0,7 -9525 - 0,3 * 43645)"
Wow. Just completely shameless.
"It's genuinely scary that you have a major, mainstream news outlet that can get away with peddling that rubbish.

As a Brit it just blows my mind, the idea of seeing that sort of interview on like the ITV news or something seems pretty much impossible."
"""Yeah ... I'm a fascist dictator and we are trying to establish a totalitarian government, so what?""

I can't believe that the United States came this close to becoming a fascist government. Shameful."
Holy fucking shit they’re not even trying to hide it
Wow so third world
"Wow - just - *we're waiting for the Supreme Court to invalidate an election where more people voted for the guy we don't want to win (but making it sound Constitutional)* \- basically. 

As it is, the popular vote margin is 3+ million, and will continue to grow, while we're just a tiny hair away from Biden clinching the Electoral College, very possibly with Georgia in the mix."
Not gonna happen
"And THIS is why Biden needs to win more than 270. Either 290 or 306. You can't litigate the entire effing country but you can litigate one state.

Even with the votes in PA where they pulled this shit, it's nod nod wink wink if Trump is close we'll help you. But if it's a blowout even a SC decision in his favor does not change the end result. No blood on his justices hands and they ""helped"" him even if it doesn't matter."

"Trump won 306 on election night, we'd have to wait until the Electoral College vote to make sure there are no faithless electors"
"I want it to be a big enough margin it can’t end up in the courts, but I also wouldn’t mind if it’s much closer than we would expect or even want. Would love for the GOP to double down on Trumpian politics and pander to his loony base instead of realigning like they should, and also would love Dems to have incentive to nominate a better candidate moving forward. There are a lot of young promising dems the establishment might not like, but the people do. I’m partial to Andrew Yang myself. I’m not sure if a close election does either of those things, but I think a landslide means GOP will separate themselves from Trump and reinvent themselves and DNC will continue to stick to the same old formula."
"I don't care about the symbolism, I just want him to have enough EVs that the faithless electors don't matter. I'll be shocked if he has less than Hillary did."
He is the malware.
Like windows update.
Shame...if only the GOP had some method of avoid this
"Keep going, I'm close"
I hate that it’s come down to being so close but this shit is spicy and I take solace in the fact the trump is probably the color of a tomato with steam coming out of his ears while the GOP is falling apart and trying to put the pieces back together in time to cinch a run off in Ga and avoid losing the senate.
"They don't seem to realize that politics is a two-way street.  Next time a Trump or one of their allies needs a favor from congressional Republicans, they'll remember these comments.

"I wish they'd shit or get off the can already. Some of us are trying to work here, I can't keep up this pathological refreshing of news sites."
Gonna be magnificent when they don't even matter
Not true to NV. They had a presser earlier today as well as updates saying they wont finish counting for a few more days because of there unique absentee ballot system
It's going to stay that way too. They both announced no more updates until tomorrow morning
Uh no they dont. They've added about 200k votes to AZ today and well over that in NV
"Fascist tactic, the enemy is both invisible, always visible, inferior, but overwhelmingly powerful at all times."
"or in 2016 or in 2000, 2004. or in countless midterms in recent years... etc."
"That's the whole thing with Democrats.  They're so bad at conspiracies and they want to run the government. The nerve.  Try to steal in 2016 and they put all the fake votes in the state they were going to get anyway. It's like they don't even know how the government works! Try to run a pedophile ring, but they put the kids in a pizza place literally anyone can walk into and they forgot to install the basement.  Buildings, what are those? It's lucky that white rich men built this country.  Oh, and they let a crackhead failson in on the pedispiracy. Nepotism is terrible, what's next? Letting your *daughter* and her husband run shit? And to top it all off, they try and steal this election and forget to steal the rest of the government.  I swear. The worst fucking secret society."
"Of they would be able to partake in the liberal activity that is ""critical thinking"" they wouldnt vote republican, so yeah..."

Runoff is Jan 5 so it would be a predictor if 2021 will be a good year or not.
FOX and the GOP will be jumping off the Trump ship to save face
"Trump's hick supporters think ""poll watchers"" means any idiot with a gun can wander in and watch."
"I'm so glad the actual analysts and reporters at fox won't carry water for trump's idiotic claims anymore. On the flip side, I love watching their talking heads moan about how sad and unfair these results are."

Best part is when they cut back and Trump is still rambling from his little written paper

Same! From the backwoods too!
Take credit anyways for making Georgia this close. Thank you for doing your civic duty and voting.
Thank you for your contribution!
You should.
"If it does, I’ll buy you a pizza or something similar if you somehow don’t like pizza"
"Fine. If it goes up by two, this Georgian here is taking cred for that."
Ok but if it goes blue by 5 votes I call dibs on the other 4 cause I took my niece and little sister to vote for the first time and I made sure my two nephews voted.

Correct.  certified observers from each party.  they just want the avg joee off thee streeet to go in and create chaos. they got laywers out the wazzo and press in the counting rooms.
70% gives him a 40k edge too
And that number has gone down from 78% in the last hour or so because we have had a couple big drops from Trump country which Biden STILL won (the last one) by 69%. We haven't had a drop for a while from the much more populous Democrat strongholds

Trump ever conceding is about as likely as him admitting his spray tan looks tacky
That would be a great movie
"And as likely as FDR coming back and shifting the dems left.

I feel like I believed that too because the media and opponents said it so much that I just took it as a given. This election proves otherwise
"Seeing Trumps numbers, I don’t think anyone else running could’ve beat him"
People will disagree but it's clear the damage of fox news and Facebook have done to the republican party is extensive. They are unthinking and very brainwashed.
I feel like a large portion of that is voting Biden because he isn't Trump rather than because of who he is himself.
"As a progressive I want to argue that point... but I'm exhausted and can't anymore.  Yay Biden, I hope he kicks Trump in the butt on his way out the door."

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th5uVIhQ8VY&ab\_channel=ComedyCentral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Th5uVIhQ8VY&ab_channel=ComedyCentral)

Fast forward to about 4:15 in."
Troll the courts and tell his supporters to start shooting.
Would be great if he just walks out
All I know is that he'll resign in time to get pardoned by Pence in January.
"Oh.. eat fast food, rage tweet, and nuke the blue states probably."
"Despite his best efforts, truly."
Shit he tried to
He damn well tried when he hit that dude with an air strike
"The right looked to act anti war now. It's good, but they're still hypocrites"
in the navy we'd say you don't get rewarded for doing what youre supposed to do
Despite his best efforts. Wasn't ridiculous escalation with Iran what kicked off the 2020 crazy train?
I love the guy calling him out now.
"Silly OP, Fox News doesn't consider the people and government of Iran ""real people"" because they're SCARY AND BROWN. So that's why killing their top general back in January wasn't counted."
That is a very commonly held position amongst Trump supporters.  It's one of the reasons you almost always hear for why they support him.
I'm not entirely sure that's true. Trump never started a war with a foreign nation. Domestically though.. that's another story.
"They either want the count done faster or to make sure the count is accurate so you naturally are going to be slower to do that. You can't have it both ways, what clowns."
"They don't have to. Fox ""News"" is low-brow high-drama entertainment for the gullible."
Nor reality.
They just want easy shit for Russia to hack.
All votes matter!
"Lots of people were to young for the 2000 election, but it was decided by 600 votes. 

Georgia could possibly be closer"
Yeah I've been trying to figure out what happens if there's a literal tie in a state. Obviously still highly unlikely but that's the range we're looking at.
"The inevitable recount will be very interesting, since recounts usually result in a variance of a few hundred, and a few hundred or less appears to be the margin of victory in this case."
That would be glorious
I was just thinking the same lol
Id fucking cum in my pants dude
That would make my whole life
The look on his face would be priceless if that did happen.
"The number of news outlets that just decided to stop giving a fuck is both staggering and hilarious.

Imagine a news agency cutting away from a sitting president giving a live speech to the American people. Now imagine four of them doing that. I'd have never thought to see it."
"I don't think 11/12 means no more results though, just not full results right? We prob only need a few 10k more for it to be called."
"Probably that BBQ, Beer and freedom guy"
"Ffs

I'M SICK OF THE WAITING AND I'M CANADIAN 

Can we hijack this thread and just be a support group for one another? 

What do you want Nanoo. If it's within my powers than I will grant it to you.."
Are these remaining states going to try and hot-potato who has to announce the deciding win for Biden and subsequently incur Trump's wrath?
Seems like Nevada does not want to be the ones to decide the election
"I mean, the population continually grows so it's not as crazy as it sounds."
And Trump has 2nd highest in history?
All things considered. This is at least a small glimmer of hope. Still horrifying how close it is.
Yeah. Don’t let the bullshit that Biden was a bad candidate affect you. The fact is that Trump’s popularity is under appreciated and overlooked and I really believe that Joe Biden is the only one on the Dem roster who could have pulled this off besides maybe Michelle Obama.
And this is in spite of voter suppression. We also have the younger populace and immigrants who don't can't yet.
"This;

I understand that everyone wishes this was more of a landslide, but from my perspective this is still a statement win. Trump will likely break the OLD record for popular vote, well exceeding his expected performance AGAIN, and even with all of that, America will STILL reject trumpism. This is the most embarrassing defeat ever, an incumbent shattering records with a cult like base is still going to be forced to concede because it wasn't enough."
Dems need to maintain that and grow it. Facism is on the doorsteps of America.
"It's great, but also incredibly disheartening to know 68,770,637 Americans think Trump is the better option for their future."
"The thing is, Trump is #2 after him now. This was just a colossally active election."
I'm just shocked at how many crazies turned out
I mean is it tho? Is the part of the voting eligible population that didn’t vote sane or not sane?
"That last dump of 6000 votes helped Biden close the gap! If it continues, Biden will win by 8-10k votes"
"If so, thank you from a northern guy—thank you, thank you, thank you! South saves the day. If! It happens."
Hell I just might move back.
"https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html

This shows Biden up by 30K once it's all over."
can you wait till after they flip thos two senate seats or send money to them to help them win.
you got money?
It’s going to be extremely close.
Fried peaches have never tasted better.
Yeah. They just don't want to call it because of the AZ situation. AZ was called by Fox and AP. If NV was called too that would be 270 but the AZ situation looks like it shouldn't have been called yet
Same with PA
~~Pakistan~~ Nevada is InDaBag!
Pakistan is in da bag
"Great. In 6 months, they'll finally finish counting them."
"Don't jinx it, don't jinx it!!!!"
Don't count our chickens before they hatch!
Lol Georgia’s already Trumps. Not enough votes for Biden to catch up
"I'm not so sure. Even if Biden passes Trump tonight, it won't be by enough votes to guarantee his victory. We have to wait for all the overseas/military/recount/provisional ballots, et cetera.

I think it's a coin toss, unless Biden wins by 10,000 or something."
you sure?
It’s 10k votes away from turning though
"What the fuck are they doing, finger painting?"
You should definitely get it either way.
you should buy it anyway
Should probably buy it anyway
"yo do it, Andre 3000 is brilliant"
Don’t have it yet? Scrub.
International underground...
You should get it anyway.  Classic after classic.
You should already have that
You won’t be disappointed
"I'll actually hold you accountble to this! For the record, Aquemini and ATliens are both number 1."
"Honestly, you should buy that either way. Outkast is one of the best cultural influences we’ve had here."
And who actually attends the 'rona briefings.
I'm really going to enjoy being able to hear him talk without wanting to claw my eardrums out.
I think they have a Twitter account you can @ them.
What did he do now?
"Someone send Trump and Biden to a beach episode.

Maybe they'll defeat a giant crab together, and realize they both have a mutual interest in defending american shores, and form a wordless fractional respect for one another. But it'll be non-canon so they'll forget about it immediately afterwards."
This is season two of walking dead
"As a Canadian, this is all I wanted. Americans can continue to shoot themselves in the foot by stupidly voting Republican Senators, but at least now we know NATO is stable and random tariffs won't happen."
Now till Jan 20 will be vewy very dangewous...
trump accidentally presses the nuke button as hes dragged out of the office
Honestly they could call it
"Oh man, if Biden gets 56% of those votes, he’s in the lead...

EDIT: and he’s currently at 57.7% in Chatham!"
Chatham is democratic? Asking as European
"No joke, my ass didn’t know where most states where until this stupid ass election."
Biden aint even President yet and he already made us smarter!
Football lasts a while but not this long.
"The NBA and NFL, where the last two minutes take half an hour in real time."
Combined with the last two minutes of a basketball game. Unlimited fouls.
If the last two minutes of a football game lasted for three days lmao
"Imagine what the last 2 minutes of 2020 is going to be like lol.

I feel like I've aged 10 years having to live through this past year let alone this election."
"As a seahawks fan used to late games being worse than this, we've got plenty of time"
did he just misspell your
The party got what they wanted from them and are leaving them to sink
I saw this!!! It warms my heart.
Thx. I needed that.
What a dipshit.
"he sounded so smug and malicious like he was about to boom her but c'mon reporter dude this isn't arcane civics she's talkin about, you got boomed instead"
I missed it. Wtf happened?
She is really sharp
"Crushed that answer, she's a beast."
I don't live in PA and had no knowledge of her before this election but that response made me a supporter.
if he loses I'm really hoping he goes scorched earth on the GOP and tells his supporters to boycott that election
Yeah that is what I am hoping. Without Trump a lot of his supporters might lose sight of any future worth fighting for. But a Democratic senate under Biden? That is a tantalizing prize for Democrat voters as long as the message gets out to participate.
I don't necessarily think this will happen but I've had the same thought and hope it to be the case.
Wouldn't it basically have to be close to max turnout for there to be a chance?
"That election will be insane, it’s for control of the senate.  I can’t imagine turnout will be low"
"Watch those Freudian slips. ""Convicted."""
I feel like I've been reading this for eternity
Don’t forget Atlanta possibly!!! 🤞🏼
and pheonix
Seriously things looked pretty bleak Tues night. Madison and Detroit pulled it out for the rest of the USA. Thanks northern fam we owe you.
Put your hands up for Detroit....I love this city! Duppaduppadoopduppadoop
"Almost as if the centres for technology, governance, economics, education, literature and business overwhelmingly vote for intelligent, rational and progressive candidates while people who live in trailer parks and consider Fago a healthy substitute for water overwhelmingly vote for inbred fucking idiots just like them."
"You gotta give some credit to the outnumbered people outside of those cities, that made the lead small enough for the city to overcome."
was the turnout more in Madison vs Milwaukee?
"It’s too soon, maybe GA will flip by then"
Lmao imagine how glorious that would be
Like Michigan was called when Rudy was speaking. ON FOX NEWS. xD

Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.

don't look at us!
"Yes, i had never seen baboon shit either."
welcome!
"A lot of conservatives ONLY watch fox ""news.""

Let that sink in."
"Trust me, we all feel the same way."
"It's so pathetic it can't legally be considered a News network it is technically ""Entertainment"" but don't tell that to anyone who swears by it."
Now you know why so many Americans are so far gone
Most of us have a bunch of family and coworkers who watch hours and hours of that each and every day. And that's actually more tame than some of their other media consumption.
"Yeah half the country believes them, sorry"
Unfortunately they aren't even the most right wing news we have.  OAN makes them look like MSNBC and CNN.
Welcome to half of the country.
That's what we're dealing with. And that answers any questions about why or how so many right wing Americans are so mentally disoriented and lost.
It's mask off propaganda and legally qualifies as entertainment
There are people who believe they live in that world.
What a blowout. How absolutely embarrassing for trump.
"This is good, I'm pinning my hopes on PA.  NV looks like it'll turn out okay, but AZ looks in real danger of flipping."
nice
Trump will take off his mask and reveal Sasha Baron Cohen.
"THAT'S PUTIN'S MUSIC!

*rides out shirtless on a bear*"
"In before the Rs say the UN is corrupt. Wait, they think every institution except their own is corrupt."
That wont freak out the one world government conspiracy wackos or anything!
Why would we want to invite foreign powers to oversee our elections?
Cookies
"""According to your Republicans, no Russian interference. Whatchu gonna do?"""
Crazy... Biden needs essentially the same margin in both
[deleted]
"It's like pottery, it rhymes"
Holy shit!
I think Biden will take GA if they have the 43k remaining correct
They already have started talking about the deficit.
"Did he really use the term ""banana republic""? Does he even know what that means?"
Who is going to enforce the law? The DOJ?
Being a Trump helps.
Because 69 million people don't mind the horrible things the Trump family does.
america doesnt prosecute its wealthy and we are seeing the absolute extreme end of the failures to do so
He's rich and has a powerful family. That's pretty much all you need to get away with a good number of stuff.
You got it boo
Press conference coming up according to fox
As a Pennsylvanian whose county is still being counted im hoping we flip blue!
"Tbh, they should have been like him and just got better /s

Edit. As in, that's his logic, not mine!"
"He'll never honor the people he helped murder, but it wouldn't matter if he concedes or not, if he loses he gets dragged out of the white house one way or another, even if that means kicking and screaming"
"Its why Trump is a traitor, a 1000 things like this just casual treason all day long, hes the president not crazy uncle bob."
This will be Trump tonight or tomorrow. Smh
Why are they all like this? Sore fucking losers lmao
He is a well known Trump sycophant so this only makes sense.
Doesn't matter if he concedes or not.
And the true colors are revealed.
"Dumbass see, dumbass do."
What a sore loser.
Classis loser who can't accept reality
hes hoping his michigan extremists take care of gary lawl
Typical
He should get over himself
"That is entirely tru. However, what's far more worrying is, half of the country ALSO want a dictator."
That's what the Resolute Desk is for.
Nothing is official until it is official.
Also they could be done today so not even the next few days and we don't even need to finish counting. Biden just needs to pull ahead and it will be called
Big if true
"[LAST ROUND, VICTORY IS RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SAauRyKRH8)"
Reminder that we are in the margins now and most statistical modelling and projection is going to be useless. Wait for the counts.
Oh shit!!!
dripping in condescension haha
"I have already called PA, why are they counting? I have called it !!"
Will he claim victory like he tried to claim some states.
"Wait, let's hear him out. He might have some level headed wisdom to impart upon us."
Jake tapper is a wonderful linguist
"ooh, yes."
That's my hope. Philly drops right before he goes on.
We interrupt Trump's speech to announce...
He'll be all coked up for sure.
"To be fair, its pretty unprecedented - not many presidents lose the second term, so what are you supposed to say with that shame hanging over you?"
That was funny
"I
Thought she died"
saw that too lol
Can't have a war if you're the only ones that show up to fight lolol.
Gravy seals are all bark and no steak
Where
Source?
"Yep, even if Daddy calls the forces to arms on his upcoming speech, the impotency of the force that arises will be laughable."
"100% expected by me ngl. He energy is with the youth, and the youth is heavily left leaning"
Imagine having to de-insanify Trump speech. How much does she get paid for that?
"Wow, Fox News fucking turned on them real fast didn’t they.  I didn’t believe it when I was first hearing some surprising things out of them but now I’m seeing that more and more.  Who woulda fucking thought?!"
"I can't wait until the day I hear the phrase ""what Donald Trump was saying..."" for the last time. The spinning the last 4 years has been incredible"
She's really gonna go down with the ship I guess.
This is so cathartic
"Haha that was good but it took me a minute, the best kind"
Best comment so far lmao
not enough rashers of bacon for that tbh
me
D&D could’ve finished NVs votes for both this election and the next two elections by now
I had never seen the first clip. Thanks for sharing that.
Lots of respect to him.
It would be a beautiful turn of events if Biden keeps AZ because of this.
"Thanks for sharing that, I never saw John McCain in that light before. That is what America is about"
We'll see if AZ stays blue for Biden then.
"Man ive never seen that.

Fuck i miss the a time of some semblance of civility in politics. The last decade has been fucking rough."

And there's 8% left to count.
https://i.imgflip.com/4l7h3s.jpg
What does that tell you about the closing pace? Or the final margin?
It was projected to be more intense.
Wait is that right ?
PLEASE KEEP THIS UP it helps the thread alot.
He got wind Trump is doing a mass firing.
"Martial law,  seize pooling stations  activate national guard.... really there's no bottom to that barrel."
Oh fuck... I can't even imagine what Trump asked him to do now. This is legit scary.
"Military coup, maybe?"
"NY Post says he expected being fired, after having for long resisted naming army bases after *Confederate* leaders. 

In other news, the new Heinrich Himmler Lufthafen in Berlin just opened."
Very high. It will also be the most common newspaper headline. We're not as clever as we like to think we are as a species.
you just put a really big smile on my face
you fkin know it will
Let's do it.
"Right?! Like if there were Dem fraud, why wouldn't they take the House too? Fucking morons."
Or a W
"Just saw the idiots on Fox News demand, ""PROVE that there's no fraud going on."" *facepalm*"
He knows there is no evidence. It’s like a little child blaming the dog for eating out of the cookie jar.
"Are you aware that evidence is found during an investigation? In order for an investigation to be started, reasonable suspicion is enough.  **Evidence** is the product of **investigative** activities ."
1 and done.
I think the latter. It hasn’t really updated at all today.
"It's been happening ever since the NYT put out a tweet saying that the AZ votes remaining were all like heavily favoring Trump. I forget the exact reasoning, it was either about where the votes were coming from, or being same day votes or something. Ever since then, AZ has been the prime target for doom and gloom even after the initial tweet was corrected not long after."
there statistically aren't enough votes in AZ to flip the estate unless there's been a mistake.
It's just the latter.
"It's dropped steadily from 200k on election night, to 93k last evening to now"
People overreacting. They even told us last night the batch was going to lean republicans but after that it would chill out. Arizona is fine
"Those of us that are following this: https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html

Just scroll to AZ and check the percentages of the last several batches.

AZ has a very robust mail-in voting system in place and has for years, so mail ballots don't necessarily skew left the way they do in other states."
"Looks like Trump may take it very narrowly. We won't know til they count them all. All depends where these ballots left came from tho. I don't think we know exactly?? But Biden is going to win PA and it's over. No reason to panic:

https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html"
This seems to be the case. AZ has been very quiet today. Update due around 7pm local time.
The NYT has had the vote at 86% in over the last 30 hours.
"The rates here: https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html

Trump is slightly beating the rate he needs to flip it."
"The two big vote drops in Maricopa where Biden leads +4 have been going to *Trump* by 57-40 margins. Then today, there have been two drops that narrowed the lead 150 to 200 votes with just a thousand or votes each. 

There's reason to believe the 57-40 might not hold up for the rest of Maricopa's votes, but there's also a lot of red counties out there with small number of votes missing each, but in aggregate still significant considering the narrow gap."
"No indication at all, the 3 red counties left to count are small. Maricopa is the last blue county left to count and it has over 5x the population of the other 3 COMBINED."
"Based on the current numbers coming in, if Trump continues getting the same percentage of remaining votes that he has been through the day, he could flip AZ. He’s barely trending above the required percentage but it’s definitely possible."
"From all we know, a lot of things would have to go right for Trump to make up the difference. There is a large batch of votes from a swing county that has been voting Biden, and those uncounted ballots could be in Trump's favor. But we really don't know so right now the odds are in Biden's favor."
The latter
Skim chance. Betting odds are lengthening. You get 25c on $1 if Biden takes it and $3.5 if Trump does.
Well... not EVERY living POTUS.
Big issue being that all living presidents except W are Dems. You won't get the war criminal to join in a PSA. He's too busy painting and giving Michelle Obama candy
He almost looks like George Lucas
Looks like Curly of the 3 stooges with hair and a beard
"Graphic source? 

God the anxiety Georgia is giving me rn"
"This'd be better with a 95% CI, just saying."
"While you're here can you explain this user's calculations for me?  They didn't respond.  

It seems like the Dems should be projected to lose more like 85,400 votes of their lead (not 8,540) in AZ based on these numbers??"
So predicting a 4-5k margin?
When are they gonna count Chatham?
My eyes hurt
"As the old saying goes: where we go one, we go all!"
"Sometimes I have 2 screens open, so I think I'm at about 4 days in the last 3 days."
You just know none of the Trumps are serving in this “war”
Lmao bring it. Here in GA ready to die for this country to fight fascists
Jr knows he's going to jail.
"150,000+? Straight into my veins, please"
There’s literally nothing they can bring to the scotus if trump loses more than one state here.
How nice of them to tattle on themselves.
"Honest question, what is the check against the SCOTUS if they are clearly frauds and cheats?"
They are trying to be journalist. Let us applaud. It's a step in the right direction.

At least an 8.
His eyes will be the size of quarters and he won’t blink.
"Oh god, is he really? That would be amazing."
Yes
Yes.
He'll take an overdose cocaine if trump loses
I read he's gonna try to start that civil war everyone is on about. Could be fun.
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
It helps keep me from stream of consciousness texting my friend group chat
And the head of the FBI apparently.

That's a good way to disappear. Or go to jail forever.
Huh???
what the actual fuck
Sure did.. on his YouTube channel.  Everyone needs to go to YouTube and report.
Wow...I'm actually worried for Fauci.
Oh. My. God.
"Still 3000 mail ballots left, which Biden has been taking 4:1 so far. Wew lads."
It’s a good trend though!
"Got damn, every vote really does matter."
Its only going to grow. they've got 3000 ballots to count and they're going 4 to 1 for Biden.
"Nice,but meaningless. All that counts is total votes in the state."
"Also to expand on this; CNN reported that Eerie is currently going 4-1 Biden with 3,000 more votes to go."
Omggff
"Yup, Biden is crushing it even in Trump counties."
Trump seems to have angered PA.
Networks want violence. It’s good for their ratings.
Or causes violence to himself. Not the first time a disgraced politician decided to control the narrative one last time on broadcast television.
They probably will
">Networks should run his speech on a delay 

I thought that was standard practice for anything"
"There should be poetry contest for how to best describe it. ""Trump's presidency is like a beaten up car running out of gas on a highway in Pennsylvania""."
"Um, how else can I say it? ""You're being let go."" ""Your department's being downsized."" ""You're part of an outplacement."" ""We're going in a diffrent direction."" ""We're not picking up your option."" Take your pick. I got more."
This CNN reporter was ruthless! Damn I almost felt bad for Trump (almost).
"But . . . why? They're mad at Fauci because he said we should wear masks?  

If dum dum trump had told people to wear masks, he'd already be re-elected. One simple thing could have changed all of this for him."
"Ok, that crossed the line"
"50/50, here we go!"
"NYTimes has had him under 50% for the past four hours or so. But, looks like there'll be two runoffs in GA."
Thank God there was no fucking green party on the ballot in Georgia this year. That would have been the end right there if there had been
"Donny, we will tell your mother we ate it."
"Fucking hell! Thank you for this, I really needed a laugh!"
I read this in Kent Brockman’s voice.
This made me snort. Well done!

I'm here all night! \^\_\^

...no, seriously, I'm here all night. I want this crap to be over with and can't sleep. >\_<"
Aint over til its called. Ill be nervous until then.
We don't know till it happens. There is still reason to be nervous.
"I mean, it's been pretty clear for days that we're gonna win. It's just excruciatingly dragged out, and there's no unified way for people to see exactly how many votes remain to be counted."
It's just caution mate. Don't want to set myself up for a crazy depressing outcome
As well they should. If Biden takes PA then even AZ is irrelevant
Uhh duh. PA is enough even without AZ. I’m more curious on their stance on a NV call
Wow that will have Trump throw the mother-of-all tantrum.  We should all be marking down where we were in history.
"No doubt Fox is eager to call PA for Biden but not so much NV. 

PA means their early call on AZ won’t matter and people will stop giving them so much shit about it. 

NV would up the stakes making it so that Fox would be calling the entire election based on an AZ call they don’t feel so confident about anymore."
They’ll probably call it pretty much as soon as hes ahead
Ironically that was a false claim Trump made. He had 304 electoral votes in 2016.
Yes.
Yes
Yup
Yep!
"Yes, runoff for both senate races is confirmed!"
yes.
Yes
He's been under for a few hours
Biden about to launch the biggest spirit bomb yet
This is the real life spirit bomb arc in the Freeza fight
It’s over 9000?!?!
We should build a Goku $pirit Bomb to send to Ossoff and Warnock in these runoff elections Georgia's about to have.
Nice!
Yeah it's been like that for 4 hours.
"NOPE!  He's going to be forced into a runoff election on Jan 5th now.  Senate seat DENIED, for now."
Nice.
"Yep... Biden may when Georgia.  He may not.

Gina wait till all the votes are counted before I start celebrating."
Solid comment.
They seem to believe people who aren’t in the “majority” aren’t treated as well as those who are.
They think we want to do to them the same things they want to do to us
They essentially don’t believe anything that goes against their preconceived notions
"You'd think they'd end up being relieved when Biden ascends the throne and in fact no pedo storm troopers come to take their hamburgers or whatever, but I can imagine it will just make them *more* angry."
Don't do that. It's not good for you. Have a calming tea instead.
"He called out ""A dishonest few who cheated"". Bruh you lost by 85,000 votes"
Luckily whether or not you concede is irrelevant once the election is certified in a few weeks :)
"That dude is shiny and smiley on the outside, and a writhing ball of snakes on the inside"

You love to see it!
They are losing their shit!  It’s so amazing to see those smug assholes breaking!
Nothing he says makes any sense. Imagine believing this shit. WOW.
"Good gravey! That was super cringeworthy!

I mean... he, he actually almost seemed GENUINELY believing that the Government is supposed to step in and stop the election! o\_O

He's of course dramatic-acting for the audience... right?

I want AZ to go blue so badly for McCain
"Not going to lie, they had us in first half.

Its been a great (albeit stressful) distraction.
I've never related more to a comment as this one.
"I got my 3080.

Bout to get my Democracy.

Then next week my PS5.

Life is good."
"Same, but for a Ryzen 5900x"
"Trump = RTX Off

Biden = RTX On"
"6800xt right round the corner, dude. Consider it."
Me too. Just missed one in the cart at newegg by seconds.
"She gave a great answer to it, too"
"her answer was awesome tho, basically made the reporter look amateurish"
She handled it like a pro though.
Saguaro or Opuntia?
"I’d do it for you, but that shit’ll hurt."
And the demographics have been inexorably moving this direction for the last 20 years... it has only ever been a matter of time till it we went Blue.
"Trumps only up by 9500 with 50,000 left to tally, according to The Guardian, who uses AP's numbers."
Why is CNN saying 326k remaining? (At 5:45pm EST)
It ain’t over to the fat lady sings my dude
"This made me cry. I’m super unstable right now, in fairness...I spent 4:00-5:00 this morning wide awake and actually vomiting from stress/stress-related health issues and I just want one night of sleep. I know it’s so much worse for so many other people and it won’t change much for them, especially, but if it’s okay to say so, I’m fucking tired. I need this comment to hold true."
It would have already been called in a pre-2016 America
">If its what you say, I love it"
"Not saying you're wrong (really want to believe you're right), but where do you get your data?"
This is the kind of optimism I’m here for!
"As much as I appreciate that, and I do, I'm a veteran of four years ago and I will not be happy until he's dragged off of Joe's inauguration podium screaming and crying all the way to the white van."
"Reddit, Twitter, 538."
"My samsung a50 has split screen, i have cnn and reddit/twitter up"
"Same, and I'm not even American. I've been at it since 9 am. Now it's 4 am and georgia will probably flip while I'm asleep. Fuck me."
how long before they turn on their own father for not campaigning hard enough?
"> Eric Trump  
“Where is the GOP?! Our voters will never forget...,”

If they wind up losing and facturing GOP support, that would be a massive win for the country.  I hope they keep up their bullshit at this point."
Wha.....what? They have a safe space? LMAO. #makeconservativescryagain

Better start bashing in more pipes I suppose. LOL
I guess that's how you start a civil war: killing in the name of god.
This has been such a shit election for KY. Goddamn it. There's some of us actually trying here.
Rabbit Hash sounds like something you find on either a very expensive menu or a very very cheap menu.
I'm happy for him
That's +4k for Biden. Gap would be only 5.5k
Do any of our mathematically inclined friends know if this is enough?
Awesome!
Massive if factual.
Oh boy here we go. I'm feeling a Biden win tonight
"Yeah, but that means about 5,000 votes for Trump, and 10,000 for Biden, which is only a net gain for Biden of 5,000.  Looks like we need a net gain of at least 10,000 to take GA."
Are there more outstanding ballots in GA beyond Chatham County?
"That place is such a cesspool. I love talking about aliens, Bigfoot, and the Loch Ness monster as much as the next guy... they took conspiracies to a whole new, awful level."
It is refreshing going into those threads and seeing a lot of people calling them out on their shit. Namely the voter turnout fake numbers they keep posting over and over.
Remember when people would just talk about aliens and shit?
I just went over there and there's a post about Brave New World. The irony was fucking staggering
I miss going there for some UFO and JFK fun. It became so unbearable after 2016.
"Hey man, there’s still a few of us regulars who aren’t fully crazy yet."
Holding you to it
Savannah is beautiful
Savannah is beautiful!
oh yeah? saved
"You know what would be a nice number, 47.

We'll see what the PA SoS has to say in about 10 mins.  That could seal it."
Aren’t there 51 states
If that percentage keeps up this is a lock.
Any idea how many ballots left to count?
HOOOOlllYYYY!!! GA pull through!!
I do want to know what's going on in the counting room.  If the judge said they should have observers in there and they can't observe that's an issue.  But if they're trying to cause trouble and look over shoulders and fight ballots and got kicked out that's something else.  I don't care who's in there but it should be fair.
It’s going to be beautiful
Honestly think this is why others haven't called AZ yet. They want to report on Fox News saying Biden wins more than they want to report on Biden winning.
Nail in the covfefe*
Chris Wallace's revenge...
"Silly question, does it go to a run off in GA for the Presidential election ever?"
They’ll have Kamala if that happens.
Pretty sure he already has a secret service detail along with other state and local PD protection.
"He gets Secret Service protection.

I am worried about the people counting the votes. It's ridiculous that, by virtue of serving their communities and our democracy, some of them (like in Maricopa County and Wayne County) are being met by armed protesters. There may be some police nearby, but they don't get secret service protection or anything that sophisticated, and they shouldn't have to fear for their safety"
"Honestly, me too. I also think Kamala and her husband would have a large target too. America’s racism was already being shown through the Obama’s. After Trump, average citizens aren’t afraid of openly saying they don’t like her for being a black woman."
If the secret service kept Obama safe then I’m sure they are well equipped to protect Biden.
He's just a good base for reporting like white rice or potatoes.
Yeah but for now they are just killing air time until the votes come in.
"That’s kind of where I’m at. Like, he’s cool to have around and all, but he says nothing of substance. He’s the John Madden of CNN."
"> the square root of fuck all

LOL"
"I mean, the name has probably carried him a bit throughout his career."
Yeah not a fan. Jon King is a national treasure though
[deleted]
"lol no, not a chance"
"If PA finishes counting and goes to Biden, then it could be called."
They are acting like it.
PA can go blue.
We're in a time loop so no.
"No, not until at the very earliest tomorrow night."
"There’s a decent chance, yeah. Georgia and Pennsylvania could both, maybe, be called today. (Big maybe.) Same with Nevada."
I dream of a day when I have to stop of think of who I should vote for based on policy rather than ethics.
"The right needs to align itself with our views or be brutally mowed down in the street, like our peaceful protesters were."
What damage though? They've got a base of rabid fans more solid and unyielding than ever before
They won’t. The right is 100% going to double down on this shot show for 2024. I expect every candidate going forward is going to top acting like a politician and start acting like Trump.
"> but the right needs to redefine itself after years of damage by Trumpism and its likes.

That would have happened - would have had to happen - if Trump had lost Texas, Florida, South Carolina etc. But he held on, and racked up some 70 million votes in the process.

There is no Republicanism apart from Trumpism anymore. They're stuck with him and his followers for at least another election cycle, and probably far more than that."
So... is it going to get worse for Trump there?
whats the difference between election day and in person?
"In person? Is that different from election day ballots?

Quite possibly a stupid question..."
Not understanding that it litterally doesn't matter who they call it for all of the votes will be counted.
I mean. They still haven’t called AK
"How silly of them. Alaska’s polls closed at 1am ET. But Alaska went heavily red so it had no impact here and, of course, Hawaii is blue AF.

Edit: time correction"
That doesn't change the votes...
"Yeah, all those people in PA and GA who mailed their ballot in a week ago stopped voting 4 hours after polls closed because they heard AZ was going Biden. Makes total sense."
"I don't think it had to do with the times the polls closed. There's some contention there about whether calling AZ was premature based on other networks who did not call it. 

They must believe their math is accurate though, even AP has called AZ."
News channels don't decide who wins. These people are so fucking dumb.
"I’m super anxious, but ultimately it’s this. I want to be awake and watching when it starts to be officially called"
Right there with you buddy
"Same here, exhausted but I don't want to miss any of this."
History will still be there for you when you wake up :)
"Its okay to miss it. It'll be history when you wake up and see it too. Take care of yourself and get some sleep. 

Stress watching the news isn't going to change anything."
"Same exact pattern here. Hang in there, friend."
"Same! If they don't call it by 8PM tonight I am gonna get some sleep, I'm not gonna last much later than that."
Best case scenario he goes to prison
Best case scenario HE GOES TO JAIL
"We'd see a lot of pushes for ranked choice voting then, I'd imagine

Ps.  Rcv was so awesome to use during this election.  Come join us with Rcv!"
That would be amazing.
He will be the kingmaker of the Republican Party until he dies or someone more evil comes around for the cult of personality. Every Republican from now until he dies will be a Trump proxy.
Can you campaign from prison?
Someone needs to feed this to Trump right now
Can you imagine how often and how hilariously that shittily protected site would get hacked?
Was there an official call in either?
"Losing two Senate runs has to hurt.

But ... But ... I'm a black military man! My campaign logo has a helicopter!"
He lost by like 20k votes. Gtfo John James
He can go eff himself. He should be investigated in the plot to kidnap Whitmer
"LMAO, as expected"
We’ll see. The presidents comments on the military may have shifted their votes to Biden. Who knows
"My impression is that this time around, military support is more or less 60/40 Biden."
"Ah, that's unlikely Biden wins then. 

But there will be a recount for sure."
Very nice 👍🏻
Someone get on this before his Twitter account is banned!
Better than that Nevada dude
She responds to everything very calmly and matter-of-factly. She's good at her job for sure.
Setting up 2024
"""The truth will prevail."" Good Lord, she's been sitting in the middle of the biggest lies for the last four years."
I feel like John King could make any woman his ex-wife with just a brief smoldering stare.
"Well then we know marriage didn't fail in the bedroom, man goes all night"
"Dude is probably rolling in women, doubt he’s concerned about Dana Bash"
"I mean they've been divorced for a while and do all the elections together, so I think they're prob over it."
There's no way SCOTUS comes into play unless a recount runs into serious issues.
I do not think they will make it to the SCOTUS . They have nothing for a case. Ar best they will get recounts. But no biggie.
"Without proof of election fraud, he won't get anywhere."
Correct.
I think that prob gets it to SCOTUS faster.
"Even if he gets this to SCOTUS there is nothing he can get out of this. There will be hardly any relevant difference in recounts, there is nothing else he can do about it."
"It will get to SCOTUS in one form or another, although they may refuse to hear the case. 

While I don't like the outcome of Bush v. Gore, I think one thing it's easy to forget is that it sided with the finality of the initial count. I think even the most conservative members of SCOTUS will be very hesitant to do anything that completely nukes an already clear outcome. And if they do, whoever votes for it should be considered to part of a coup attempt, full stop. But I don't think it will come to that."
He will go into hibernation
He’s playing like Jordan right now
"I feel like death and I'm just sitting here watching him every day, I don't know how he does it lol"
Woah! What was the breakdown of the last batch?
But how much is left to count?
How many does Biden need now?
So that leave around 290k
"around 66% for Biden - if he keeps this up, PA is his."
"I'm more optimistic about Georgia rather than Pennsylvania. The gap in Georgia now less than 10k.
Want this to be over tonight, need some quality sleep lol"
"It should be noted, they were from areas that were more red than blue and NONE were from Philly\~"
I will go with option one
All i know is he will go to the grave claiming he won this election. He will NEVER admit he lost.
By only 48 votes though. That could easily reverse...
And all Republican Senators will say it was a brilliant move.
million a shit on the floor does count as a million votes has does anyone really know ? lol
"maybe he'll just go for damage control and try to leave gracefully

my bet is he'll be all ""go big or go home"" and start saying some nonsense about how he's still the real president in the people's hearts and tell them to prepare for the big war until he can run again in 2024 against the evil liberals"
"that was excellent, absolutely no evidence whatsoever."
You should search for the video earlier today of the MSNBC reporter questioning Rick Grennell after his press conference it’s pretty humiliating
God I wish I could watch all of the networks at once.
He's paid handsomely to argue this stuff even if he genuinely doesn't believe it.
He’s the guy who got bitten because he was getting a bj from a zombie but then says gays shouldn’t marry because it’s a slippery slope.
"If Corona taught us anything, it's that like half of America is that person."
Haha that's an awesome call
But wont manage to bite anyone when he turns
He is growing a spine
Big if true.
"Listen to this person, they're on to something!"
I’m still skeptical
big if true
As long as it's not the old one.
Uh thanks
Blasphemy
Wow what insightful analysis
"There's still one path to 269-269, even if unlikely. But it is 2020."
[deleted]
No way....source?
Nevada has entered the chat.
Source?
"""elected"" 

Plenty of room for you to be wrong on this one"
Don’t forget the fact that Biden will win without Ohio!
"John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Herbert Hoover, Jimmy Carter, George HW Bush.

5 off the top of my head. Why do I keep seeing 4?"
and people still voted for him
What were the 4 others?
"I think that is what is being missed here. Everyone says it shouldn't be this close, and I guess I can agree but to get him out of office at all is a huge win."
"also amidst massive voter suppression, disinformation and a deadly pandemic that puts voters' lives at risk. Pretty remarkable if you ask me.

&#x200B;

Oh but it's not over yet. Let's wait and see and hope."
"Wow, as a president you are more likely to be shot than to not be reelected?"
Non-American here. Can you name the 4 incumbent presidents who were ousted?
"Jimmy Carter, Bush Sr, and hopefully Trump.

who was the 1st?"
I don't think that is true
Huh? We’ve had a ton of single termers.
"I think there have been more than that, but it hasn't happened often in recent history, and it usually requires a strong third party candidate. The coronavirus hurt him, but the fact someone as horrible as Trump almost won reelection shows how hard it is to beat an incumbent without a strong third party taking votes away from them."
Man Carter should have had a second run. Too bad. The 80’a could have been a different time.
"Isn't it weird that an impeached president can get reelected?

Seems a little like someone forgot to put that in the constitution or something"
"That's not right. Bush 41, Carter, Ford, Hoover, Taft is 5 and that's just the 20th century. Harrison, Cleveland (though he ran 4 years later and won), J.Q.Adams, John Adams, also all lost as incumbents."
"That's incorrect. Adams, Quincy Adams, Cleveland, Harrison, Taft, Hoover, Ford, Carter, H.W. Bush."
"Presidents that ran for a second term as an incumbent have lost 10 times. It happens on average every 20 years.

1. J. Adams
2. J. Q. Adams
3. M. Van Buren
4. G. Cleveland (won 2nd term, but lost when he was incumbent)
5. B. Harrison
6. W. Taft
7. H. Hoover
8. G. Ford
9. J. Carter
10. G. H. W. Bush"
"Not true. The number is like 15... Adams, JQA, Van Buren, Tyler, Tayler, Pierce, Buchannon, Johnson, Cleveland, Hayes, Taft, Hoover, Ford, Carter, GHWB."
Because John doesn't regurgitate their narrative.
The right only have the hots for the bloated pumpkin and his walking cadaver
He's is probably the only person they like from there lol
They even hate fox news at this point
But >99% counted...its *really* coming down to the wire.
"If that holds, he'll be up by 100k by the time they're done."
Looking good!
"To add to that, he needs 60% average to beat trump in PA"
That’s enough to win it for sure if we can keep that average.
double runoff for Georgia!
"2 runoff Senate races in Georgia, that possibly just flipped blue for Biden?

LET'S FUCKING GO!!!"
"Both the GA senate races will be a run off, potential here to take both seats."
"Nah, keep it classy the way he has been. No need to stoop to Trump’s level"
He's on his knees sucking donald his God off
Fuck Gary Johnson
"But Jo Jor....nope, couldn't keep a straight face"
'Viable third party candidate' is probably the highest praise Gary Johnson has ever earned
"That's exactly what happened in Minnesota. Trump actually improved by 0.3%, but lost by a 6 point larger margin."
"Can't imagine all Johnson's voters would go to Biden, they are way more ideologically similar to Republicans."
It's nearly as nice as watching the paint dry on the growing grass.
"if biden drops ""america wants no more malarkey...you're FIRED trump"" or summ i'll be so happy"
That’s one pissed off wood gnome
Love it
The salt sustains me.
Where are they Lou? They got theirs and said fuck you
whoa he's like HELLA MAD
HA!! That was wonderful!
Barr has been mia for a while now
"""Where are all the people who can help my friend subvert democracy?!?  It's almost like Trump isn't liked and all these people were simply sycophants using the President for political and financial gain."""
She wasn’t playing around. I like her.
Who?
What did she say? At work haha.
What happened?
She handled that so tactfully too
Fuck that piece of shit. The world would better off without him being in it.
Did I miss impeachment #2?
"Oh man.. Do I even want to know?

Also, spell his name right please. It's Gym. Don't be rude."
Wait did we skip another impeachment I dont know about?
I think you mean before the 2024 election.
"""1..2...3... Fuck I lost count.

1..."""
The competition now is what comes first: Nevada's results or Cyberpunk 2077
Can it finish before both candidates die of old age?
"[https://twitter.com/NateSilver538](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538)

Nevada is in the bag"
Oh man.. that flip will be a glorious moment
source on this? That'd be huge
I don't know why but I have a feeling a shit ton of Philly votes are going to drop during primetime for the haymaker.
Exactly.  Trump gets the stupid vote.
"He's retiring, so he's apparently free to speak the truth."
Well we’re living here in Allentown...and we’re voting all for Biden now...
Bethlehem Chad... or Allentown Virgin?
"Directly said votes shouldn't be counted that were cast under rules that voters understood to be valid at the time they cast them.  I could see them striking down the rule, but throwing out the ballots should not be allowed."
Agreed. I’m from PA too lol
That's a very high bar to set for such a distinguished man
They will leave the country.
Cocaine or Coca-cola?
He will go full scarface and up his consume.
And no one tells him until he takes questions.
"It could happen, since it sounds like they're sitting on counted votes that just haven't been reported."
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
They're already exploding
"Seems like treason to me. At the very least, inciting violence."
You're gonna wake up to president-elect Biden! Lucky.
See ya! I have high hopes that it will be a sweet morning for us Europeans.
Oh man you're gonna miss his speech.
don't sleep yet! not before Trump speaks in 30 minutes!
Don't! We need you!
Everyone would ignore him 😂
He can’t. States control their elections.
"If he did that he would automatically lose, since he is behind in AZ and NV."
Won't mean anything more than anything else he says. He has zero authority over how states administer their elections.
"I wouldn't put it past him to try. I'm almost entirely positive it would be illegal per the constitution and even most of the conservative judges in SCOTUS wouldn't let it fly. 

So let him try and lose."
Not sure he even has the power.  Elections are run by the states.
50/50
It would mean nothing.
"I mean, like 0%"
"I mean, he literally has no power to."
"What, and hand Biden the victory? If he does that, NV goes to Biden and he wins."
why would that be followed though
So he would lose?
Dunno. The odds of the states telling him to fuck off if he does that are 100 percent though
It would be in court at the speed of light.
"Literally does not have this power, as elections are held at the state level, not the federal."
He can't force the states to do anything
The would be hilarious. He would lose.
"That would be funny.

He doesn't have the authority to do it, but it would be funny to watch him try."
That's not how that works
I 100% expect him to bash the media try to claim victory
"Maybe he could order DC to stop counting, but the states all have jurisdiction over their elections, not Trump."
Well if he somehow was able to do that not only would we win he'd also start a civil war.
"Might as well put out an executive order banning the sun from rising, it would have the same value"
Yes and yes.
Yup :D
Yep
I think in that scenario it's 50/50 with vp being tie breaker
Yep
Correct!  We can thank Stacey Abrams and her work at [Fair Fight](https://fairfight.com/about-fair-fight/) for the incredible things we're seeing in Georgia. Donate and get ready to volunteer. Voters can be registered through December 7 and begin early voting in mid-December for the two US Senate runoff races. It's our last chance to fire Mitch McConnell.
"if biden wins then yes, Harris will then be the deciding vote in the senate."
If that makes it 50-50. VP Harris would give majority control.
My parents are halfway joking about buying a house there for 3 months solely to be able to vote there. They are retired but are tired of Rs and have money to spend to do so.
They would get 50-50 and if Biden wins then they have control cuz of Kamala.
If Biden wins we would gain a majority because tie breaking vote would be cast by Harris
Yep
Yup!
I want to say it's hard. Especially based on NC AZ  MI  data
yis.
"I think so, yes. I am from Georgia and I am going to bring attention to it EVERY WEEK. I will ask others to do the same. Fuck Mitch."
It would be a tie and the VP would break the tie. So I guess so.
Yes. That would be 50/50 and Vice President breaks ties
yep
"I think tie, then the breaker would be Kamala"
Possible Kamala Harris as the fucking tie breaker. Imagine the optics. Imagine the meltdowns.
Yep! I'm hopeful... democrats may be energized at the prospect and republicans may lose the wind in their sails.. if trump loses.
I’ve been casually prying this info out of colleagues. I was surprised to find a few extra Biden supporters at work.
little wave and a wink. Go Joe!
He says president's spawn a lot too lol
They've been saying it since election night. And I can't tell if it's a jab or serious lol
His podlings
"Yeah these Republican states are just ""finding"" votes for Democrats because.... ?"
How many left to count?
"Its unbelievable, Georgia's totally going to flip blue."
What county?
Danke!
where is that Germany Biden you're referring to?
"Ahem, it’s “China Biden” thank you very much"
"Also watching from Germany, but I just got back from deployment, so no work tomorrow for me"
"Na, once they won't be blamed for Biden winning they'll come clean."
Nevada might finish counting votes in time for inauguration.
Meanwhile Alaska chuckling to themselves about how they won’t even bother starting to count their shit for at least a week
Put all the chips on black and a couple on double 0.
"At this rate, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada are trending toward Biden."
"Why do you believe Biden will win PA tonight?  I'm not really doing the News thing, just looking at the numbers, so I'm curious to know why you are lead to believe that.  I hope you're right, but can you clarify why?"
When tonight? And how do you know? What info do we have on how quickly PA will be counting?
It’s how I know shit has hit the fan for him. I love it.
You know he's just stewing in the oval office right now.
"There seriously must be someone physically restraining him.

Or he was hoarse on the fox call in because the corona overcame his steroids, and the tweets are his staffers best attempts at a weekend at bernie's."
"This really must be a surreal experience for him. He was the center of attention for nearly the entire world for four years. He occupied everybody’s headspace at least once a week, if not every day.

And now it’s all over. No more power. No more influence. No leverage over anybody. And worst of all (for him), the bill is due. It’s due on SO MUCH shit he has done. Sobering. Surreal."
Stop I can only get so hard.
"Wow, that's like the smallest of margins.  Hopefully we don't get any shenanigens like 2000 FL."
Does this include military votes?
Summary “we are really slow at this and won’t have an answer for you this week”
And it’s going to happen again and again
Can't wait to hear that line again when the show comes back.
"Spoiler alert, it's not. Not that this rate at least"
Absolutely not. Let’s rotate the board!
I’ve invested too much time in this for it to all happen while I’m asleep!
"i didn't see your flair at first and thought ""but its only 4:30 pm??"""
It's def ending up in a recount
yup
"I know, she is smiling ear to ear."
Trying to keep it on the low low though. Admire the effort but I'm so ready!
They vote for that hard (R)
"lots of ""own the libs"" voters who would vote for a toaster oven if it was on the republican ticket

these are the types you'll hear complaining about how Joe Biden is a pedophile or whatever on FB but caveating that ""they don't support either candidate"" riiiight"
"yeah, and tbh i think people are reading into it just a little bit too much, acting like we have an extreme racism and fascism problem.. sure maybe to some degree, but a lot of trump voters are just not very informed and dont like democrats and its not much more complicated than that"
This! Going against an incumbent is always hard. That’s why there are so many multi term congress members and the last single term president was 27 years ago.
"Absolutely, there are plenty of people asking about what Biden’s policies are now that they realize he might win. *please research before you vote*"
My appetite has been crappy
I’m on my 16th course
The asl man is giving it his all. Matching her very clear tone
"""I sure hope your trying to shape the outcome""
(That sounds like election interference to me)"
*desperation intensifies*
"Wow. There is a man with a platform and issues on display. 

Wow."
This shit gives me life. The other Republicans aren't doing anything because they know nothing is fraudulent.
"I don't watch Fox, is Dobbs actually agreeing with him or is he saying he's full of shit?"
One coronary for Mr. Dobbs pls.

"> Can you imagine all the segments they could do where he says ""well, as a black man...""

It irritates the shit out of me that the media treats black people like we’re a hive mind. In all my years of watching/reading the news I’ve yet to see one “white people expert.”

It’s the strangest thing."
"Fox News also has their fucking cameras in there. What do they think, that the right wing propaganda machine is turning on Trump?"
Same but I’m probably not following the “right” people
Always and forever.
"Oh no, you're forgetting that COVID stopped on Nov. 4."

So nothing new in since 2016
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
I hope he has the same fate as poochie

I didn't know he was a Mormon?
She... was... a... pollster.
but I thought GOP loves voter suppression?
Definitely.
What's going to the Supreme Court? He's got nothing.
That’s what I’m afraid of. I feel like they will try to steal this away from the American people.
They'd be disgraced
"Mitch wouldn't let it get to that. This current result is the absolute dream of the Republican establishment. They got their judges, they retain control of the Senate, they got rid of the nutjob who let it all happen before he completely destroyed the country."
im freaked out.
We def are
Guaranteed.

I think this is my favourite comment from the last 72 hours. Thank you.
Specifically trump-pictured-as-Rambo flags
At least give the person their credit.
Live in Florida. Can confirm the number of flags on trucks is definitely not Trumps problem
"Read on NPRs page that there is still 47,000 ballots left to count, but wont have an update until Friday."
"Back on track.. I've seen break downs on twitter of all the remaining counties along with their mail in splits so far, and the expectation is that Biden can net another 15ish thousand from the votes remaining. Which would put him up 6-7k (ie basically the same as your current estimate).

Not sure how many provisionals, disputed, military etc votes there are left to count which are not being included yet."
Please clap!

Don’t insult shit. He’s lower than that.
Oh absolutely. Then he’ll have paid rallies and make money there and Fox News won’t make a peep about it or cheer him on. But Bernie or Obama writes a book/does a paid speaking gig and it’s “Omg the elite!”
Fox was among the first to call Obama's landslide in 2008. They look better getting an admission of defeat wrong than they do falsely proclaiming victory.
Oh that would be fun to see. He’d lose his goddamn mind if he sees Fox call it.
"Fox’s polling division is in charge of calling states, and they’ve been historically pretty accurate and non-partisan about it. 

It’s one of the few areas where they don’t mislead people."
I was expecting NV.  So they would be to lonewolf calling it for Biden early.
"They are also leading the questioning of vote counts, and spreading disinformation, so it probably helps them to have a winner to rally against."
"It's no different from regular CNN, which returns from every ad break with ""BREAKING NEWS.""

There's almost never any actual breaking news."
I thought sanatorum was what my brother in law complained about when discussing his dating life.
Awesome movie!
Hollywood should make a movie about all of this when it’s over.
Looking fuckin good
9k in GA now.
Feeling really great about it
He will get 75%
unreal how close it is
Biden +16 is like the bare minimum needed to pull it out. Is that the county as a whole or the mail vote in the county?
Well find out Nevada's results around January when the next president takes over.
It should be called.  They aren't calling it because of the fucked up AZ situation previously.
"Wasn’t the gap already 9k? Did Chatham finish counting, or are there still ballots from Chatham?"
Does the 10000 lead factor in those votes from that county?
Hopefully. It's not over until it's over. Fucking crazy though.
Where is that 40k number coming from?
Math is off. 7k lead.
I don’t think your math is right but it would still give him a narrow win.
Check your math!
what percentage would that put Biden's lead at? past the point of a recount?
"By my math that means 28,000 Biden, 12,000 Trump for a net 16,000 gain. That puts the final margin at +6500 Biden."
Keep in mind that there is also 8K overseas votes that may come in.
I remember the thread 69 jokes.... we shall see
"We might end up in like the 60+... 

We have 6 states left. And if Pennsylvania goes to biden tonight, we’re gonna have a field day!"
see you in part 69
Part 60 incoming
Just wait for thread 67!
My guess was 45 would be the final one.
I lowkey think we’ll get it
"Every election I hear ""Nate Silver was SOOO wrong""

and then.... like magic.... he's right"
"When you consider they have a 3-4% error, this is certainly true. They may end up a little off, but not so much as to create all these dumb headlines."
only in terms of EC tho right? Actual margins in states seem to generally be quite off - 538 covered this quite well in predicting that even a Hilary magnitude polling error wouldn't necessarily cost Biden the election
The polls said Biden was up 5 points in Florida. So no.  No it isn't.
"Polls off like crazy in WI, MI and FL so no"
I hear it's very dark there..
They're drunk.
They are too cold?
"Dog Sled carriers take some time..

😀"
They have til November 12 for absentees to be received. Don't be mad about it.
State law that delays the counting. Just consider it red and move on.
"lol, i think everyone just forgot about alaska"
Alaska can go to hell. Worth 3 electoral votes and it will be voting for trump anyways. Lol.
Alaska doesn’t matter. It does. But it doesn’t. It’s all on PA GA NV and AZ. Mainly PA because trump could win every state left besides PA and still lose.
"Cause Alaska is huge with a lot of land between where people are, some places they won't count for two weeks because people are living so remote."
Those 70 voters in ED37 (why don’t their counties have names? This is county closest to Russia - and Blue!) probably had to do mail in or something. Many Alaskan ‘residents’ only live there part of the year. They might have a later deadline for mail ins 🤷🏻‍♀️
Don't know why they're not calling it but Alaska has simply decided to wait until their mail in ballot deadline to count them.
"It may actually be better to let the full counts play out (at least to very clear levels) before calling any other races. I don't want poll workers getting swarmed by angry fascists encouraged by Trump to think ""Democrats stole the election""."
"I tried to look for an answer.  The closest answer I found is:

>In Alaska, a state President Trump is expected to carry, absentee ballots have not yet begun being counted. The state will not even begin counting absentee votes until next Tuesday, Nov. 10, and will continue counting through Wednesday, Nov. 18.  
>  
>The state began counting votes on Election Day itself, first tallying early and day-of votes, which has helped boost the commander-in-chief’s lead.

Why is it taking so long to count votes in the remaining states?

[https://nypost.com/2020/11/04/why-is-it-taking-so-long-to-count-votes-in-the-remaining-states/](https://nypost.com/2020/11/04/why-is-it-taking-so-long-to-count-votes-in-the-remaining-states/)

edit to add:

Alaska counted less than half of all ballots on Election Night. Now the waiting starts.

>And even as of midnight Wednesday, state officials had only counted a total of about 130,000 votes that came from about half of Election Day polling places, with the other half of polling places still not reporting results — meaning that altogether, more than half of all ballots still remain to be counted.

[https://www.alaskapublic.org/2020/11/04/alaska-counted-less-than-half-of-all-ballots-on-election-night-now-the-waiting-starts/](https://www.alaskapublic.org/2020/11/04/alaska-counted-less-than-half-of-all-ballots-on-election-night-now-the-waiting-starts/)"
Probably have only a few dozen counters and have to do recounts.

And their followers will take it seriously and start inciting violence against whoever they can!
They are a bunch of losers
"Doubly imagine if it’s Fox News that does it! 

I will genuinely piss myself laughing while at the tissue culture hood."
They’re not great people.
"Are they? I agree with you, if someone in my circle was supporting trump i would honestly lose my respect for them and assume they are stupid."
I remind myself there is a whole world of media out there where Trump is not shown as mean and cruel and we (Dems) are the baddies.  If you get sucked into that bubble it can be hard to see it differently just like it would be impossible for me to see Trump in a different light than I do now.
Be grateful it's only your friends and not family and spouse
Man some of my own family members support Trump. They are some of my least favorite family members but still.
"Four years ago I broke off 4 lifelong friendships with the friends I had who supported Trump. It was hard, and sad, but it saved me from so much stress the rest of my life that it was well worth it."
So what you have for lunch today?
I wonder how many romantic connections and lifetime friendships have formed in these threads over the past 24 hours.
She should be running for something big.
What did I miss?
Fuck cancel culture
What did she say 4 years ago?
Meanwhile our president\* is tweeting treason right now.
"Anyone know if ""reporter"" was from OAN?"
A few days ago maybe? New odds are tighter?
Deutsche Bank is recalling the loans when he loses. He will be flat broke. Who would marry that without money involved?
He's been rage tweeting on the toilet the entire time.
"haha, comment of the night!"
Post finasteride syndrome. It can strike at any time.
Getting pointers from Putin on a zoom call.
He’s looked and sounded like shit for a few days now. Maybe they secretly sent him back to Walter Reed.
"Wait, has he actually been of Twitter for that long?"
"As a former resident I miss you, I love you, and I wish I was there."
I’m from GA. It’s a race to see who can put the nail in the coffin first.
"Honestly you think, that after losing the popular vote in 2016, that in the last 4 years trump has GAINED voters?"
But the emails
The results were on his laptop!
They actually just said something to that sort.
"They were just bragging about how much trump accomplished, listing peace in the middle east and rubber stamping GOP court picks among them"
"Idk if you're watching but the Five literally just joked that ""Hunter Biden would be a big help in Georgia"""
"Tím Pool is seriously suggested a judge may order another election. Seriously, they want a do over. That's how dumb we've sunk"
"Nobody likes him

Except some dumbass Pennsylvanians apparently"
He sucks
He's an absolute snake. Trump loving piece of shit.
My only regret - I won’t be able to slam my vote down against Toomey in PA in 2022 because he’s retiring.
"The new Benghazi.  Ah, the good ole Republican playbook."
"I dunno,  man, I think this Hunter Biden thing has legs!

"Don’t worry. Giuliani said he has something.

He would have but the dog ate them :c
My Canadian girlfriend agrees 👍
I am erect
"Source? Still 90k, per DDHQ"
"Not really clutch, only mail-in ballots remaining and 200k still to come.

Biden will pocket that without a sweat"
That's called alternate reality and people wouldn't believe trump would have decency to do that event there.
If that happens I will go on Reddit Live and dance naked on my table singing ymca while spreading green jello on my body.
What a great surprise for 2020 that would be.
"Haha, maybe he wants to make a deal like in crime shows. ""I concede and you drop all charges in NY etc."""
We found that out 30 seconds ago come on
Great! I believe CNN projected he just needs 58-60% from here on out.
"Sheesh, 66% doesn't sound good.  More than he needs but obviously would like a bigger buffer should any lean Trump."
Down to 60% on remaining ballots to flip!
"Oh damn, never thought about that haha. That's definitely part of the reason."
Except the herpes. You take that with you.
Word salad is my new favorite phrase.

Holy fuck GA might just flip.  And PA which would seal the deal is still trending well

"Yup. He’ll gladly rule over scorched earth to stay in power. Those that have dealt with spoiled brats knew this was going to happen.

Even shoved his dad to the floor"
I think most of us expect him to say something dumb that will incite his band of idiots.
"If I got paid whatever ridiculous amount he did, I'd argue stupid shit on TV too"
He's a national embarrassment.
What a clown
Hehehehohoho
oh shit. this is it.
sheesh that could be 7-7.5k net for Biden
The math is good on this one
"If he keeps at 73%, that's a roughly ~4.5k~ 7k swing in just that one burst.

EDIT: math iz hard"
"which for those following along at home, would be enough by itself to win GA assuming that trend continues."
when????? That give Joe the win so when will they post?
So that's 5-6K right there
"Jesus  73% would be just enough for him to win. 

GA is going to be close enough that we may see a recount there."
Elaborate as to why?
Likely
I want so bad for it to be NV that pushes this guy out the door.  I'd be so proud of that!
yeah a distinct possibility. I guarantee whoever announces it is going to get a target on their back from the Trump supporters. Really our poll workers especially in purple and blue states are MVPs this election doing a democratic duty in the face of terrorism and intimidation.
That's also my thought.
why not?

you love to see it.
"I forget what it's called but theres this political theory that explains left vs right as a circle, where as you travel further away from the center in either direction (towards the extremes) you wind up getting closer in ideology to the other side.  Meaning far right and far left can sometimes have more in common than far left and middle left.  

What you just described kind of fits that theory"
So they're canceling? Awesome.

Was there a new dump?  My NYT tracker says 12k as of 9 mins ago.
"Holy crap I had pretty much written off GA. I'm not sure what counties have the most votes out, but if it's Atlanta and no surprises pop up, he has a real chance of swinging it. It'll definitely be a recount, but even if it goes Trump PA is all but sure to go Biden now."

Go birds.
If so go flyers.
I know!!
Dekalb county is incredibly blue and about 83% Biden with still a few percent left to count. That alone could flip it.
"I love Bernie, but he honestly would have been painted as a radical socialist, and probably wouldn't pull some of the more moderate left. Pete wouldn't have stood a chance. Trying to look at this from an unbiased perspective, but I think Warren and Klobuchar probably would have been the most successful, maybe even more than Biden."
[deleted]
I've heard of that too. Sincerely confused me when women don't want another woman in power
"It looks like harris, yang and sanders all would have stood a chance. Biden was the best choice though, as this really hinges on moderate votes and biden is center-right enough to have enticed them over"
A minority VP probably tightened up the race more than we expect.
Ugh this shit is too close for comfort
"Come on, Georgia!!!"
Holy shit
Wow - Biden only needs 61% of the rest!
Biden just need 61% of those to flip Georgia.
Biden has been capturing 70%. He's taking Georgia.
Pretty much lol
Yeah media really needs to do a better job of explaining things
I think half these people needed this
Military members have to pay back deferred social security for the past three months (which most already spent) if Trump loses. I wouldn't hold out hope on those votes.
I swore the next state I visit is GA if they pull it through.
Moving to the country gonna eat a lot of peaches
I have some Redd's Apple Ale to drink
Best election analyst ever
That's actually bigger than biden winning GA. It means control of the Senate is still up for grabs until those runoffs are completed. And the senate will be 49-49 on Jan. 3rd if they haven't certified the results of the runnoff by then
"45 was 99% ""fuck trump"" comments"
Good luck!
Be Best.
Good luck!
You aint missing much.
"Recap. 44 lasted approx 40 min and consisted of ppl saying Thanks, Obama. 45 lasted approx 20 min and consisted of ppl saying Fuck Trump."
How will the military votes effect biden?
Pennsylvania too. Both seem very confident to betting markets.
"honestly gambling odds have been my comfort through this. a random redditor saying ""trump might have PA"" doesnt hold as much weight as the collective opinions of millions, gambling millions/billions on this election.

I trust the people who dont want to lose their fucking money"
Fuck alaska
They also only have 3 electoral votes so no one cares

Wonder if it's cause of the significant outflows of Californians into Nevada
"No, 90% of the remaining votes are in Vegas, and therefore lean Biden.  It could/should have been called hours ago. But that would make it awkward since some, like Fox, would have to choose between recanting their call of AZ or call the whole election"

"Yes, but also down to getting 66% of the votes. He was at 72%. It's a win/lose situation. We just better hope that the remaining ballots are all mail ins from big cities."
"But we're not quite sure. She's teetering and we're like 95% sure she's going to deliver the message, but there's a nagging voice saying that she may just stay once he tells her he'll never hit her again."
He’s changed her and I really want her back to the way I remember
"It's because everyone can see it's over and they have nothing to fear from him anymore. Republicans follow the power, and they can see he lost it."

If that happened Trump would also flip during the press conference.
"It's quite likely!! It's been 34 mins. since the last update and a couple of hours since the last major update, when it went from 12K to 9K.

It'd be great if Chatham County in Savannah GA gives Biden a massive lead. Trump will go crazy.

"Even in the unlikely even they both win, 50 Senators probably isn't enough for any big policy goals. You probably need around 56 Democratic Senators for major reform. You can probably get modest reform through with maybe 51-53.

50 Senators is probably just not blocking judicial appointments or normal legislation and old McConnell doesn't get to run things (big plus obviously)."

It’s a run off for sure
We will all eat nothing but peaches for the next 4 years
I doubt as the vote number will repeat for the January 5th election. so you can probably see them go both red.
"Fuck it, AOC thread."
\*sweating*
"47,000 votes left!!!"
I’ve felt the same the past 2 days. I’m not interested in anything he has to say whatsoever
I feel such strong second hand embarrassment when he speaks that I haven't watched him in a couple years now. The cringe physically hurts.
The greatest victory
Wait what this happend
What?  Source?!
Be sure to check him out more at www.onlyfans.com/johnking
"We’re a democracy, we count the votes"
There’s something so wholesome about him lol
I'm pretty sure that 29K of these votes are not counted per state rules and the other 6K I don't know about.  It wasn't about the lawsuit.
Sucks though. Be nice if they could count it all today.
"When are they gonna be counted !? This is BS we can’t give into trumps tyrannical authoritarian fuckery. Also dejoy needs to hailed to jail, there’s no doubt in my mind Biden would have won way more easily if not for his antics . Makes me so fuckin mad these people can get away with actively and openly disrespecting our democracy"
Biden wins PA it’s over for Trump. Let’s get these votes in and call it already.
Thank you for this.
"X + Y = 40000

X - Y = 9000 => X = 9000 + Y

9000 + 2Y = 40000 => Y = 15.500

For every 15.500 votes Trump gets Biden needs to get more than 24.500 votes, or 62%"
He will win both at this rate
Treat yo self

You rebel you.

No idea but this sounds like an easy job.

She is doing a great job.

Why not both
How? Id love to do that
He has drugs for that. We don't
Love to see it
That really helped.
One of these two men will go to prison if he loses. I’d be scared shitless too lol.
So does Madam Vice President.
We won't see a multi party system until we implement ranked choice voting.
"To be fair, the left is also splintering. Not a troll, just stating it as it is."
"Nah, first past the post inevitably leads to 2 party system. Gotta change fptp and then you get more parties."
"that could be a really good thing for the country. If he campaigns on fair elections and getting rid of the electoral collage, it forces the other parties to act. And if he did split the GOP - getting rid of the electoral college would be his only chance of victory."
"Oh great, now we have the right and the alt-right"
"I mean looking at hos votes, seems like Trumpism is alive and strong which is such s shame. I really thought maybe the Lincoln project could do some damage, but no"

Seems like I've heard that expression somewhere before. . Hmm... it's on the tip of my goebbels. . .
Why did he spend in DC? Its baffling. They hate him so much and don't count towards the EC. Was it so he could see his own face on TV?
He will start go fund me campaigns to further fleece his flock.
You don't know your current county?...
I promise you he would have the exact opposite opinion if the situation were reversed.

I would love if they broke into his rant to announce that Biden won but kept the image of Trump in a PiP (Picture in Picture) to see his reaction as he hears it.

He definitely is.
Fuck yeah.
its surreal
She also said relax and don't close the book on the election when Trump is only one who's done such a thing.

"in america: very cool, very legal"
I imagine most of things we do here do.  They do to me
Its absurd for us Americans too.
Carrying a gun for most things sounds pretty absurd for most Americans.  But its a pretty difficult thing to get changed.
Sounds pretty absurd to me too and I’m an American.
It was pretty much unheard of in the states until the tea party/modern republican fuck sticks started doing it.
Some scared little weenies don't feel safe anywhere without a gun.
Such a great way to get shot by the police (In France at least)
Him not understanding that people standing there with guns is intimidation in itself is the whitest fucking thing I ever heard. You better believe if they were black they would have been arrested or even shot. I fucking hate this place.
"Yeah, if I see someone walking around carrying a weapon, I do not presume they are peaceful, unless you're security or police or something (and even there, they aren't always so peaceful).  You won't find me protesting armed, or staying in a protest where my counterparts are armed."
"I just watched this documentary, wonderful documentary. Maybe the best."
Thank you. Needed that memory and laugh
Good luck
"the thing is... if the SCOTUS invalidates this election


72 MILLION people would march and it would be insane."
"Dear god i hope that doesnt happen. No deaths or property damage please.
I hope Trump and his supporters can stay civilized..."
To like 60 million people...fuck.
"Can't figure it out, how have 70million people looked at this guy and gone yeah he's the one for me, absolutely madness."
68 mil people apparently
Alpha-male's alpha-male.
It's the closest we'd come to seeing him actually losing it. And that would be beautiful.
Wow. Any screenshots?
I see no flaws with this strategy.
"As long as the GOP has any say in it, the electoral college will never go away because the GOP knows they'll never win another Presidential election if it does."
And this is why elections should go by popular vote.
"Idk, the 1824 election was kind of a shitshow."
Yeah. That said a split in the GOP would be beautiful.
Two of the breakaways would become dominant. To destroy two party systems we need to move away from FPTP voting.
"Yes, I agree."
That would would be ideal for the Senate. Popular vote could decide the president. People and reps might not go for it tho
Unfortunately you'd have to get rid of fptp before that has a chance at happening.
Then you'll get 20% extremists winning 100% of a single seat. Most US elections aren't set up to produce satisfactory results from crowded fields.
Truth!!
Assuming he gets AZ
Need to hold AZ and win PA/GA - Nevada isn't enough by itself.
If AZ doesnt flip
Hey thanks for this breakdown? What resource do you use to see how many ballots are outstanding in each state / county?
Well it looks like Trump is gaining in Arizona. Lot of Republicans mailed in their votes there.
The question is: Is the net lead of 49K more than 1% of the vote?
Only if AZ holds tho right?
SUM - 41
Blink - 182
Blink - 182
Give it to ya - X
Eiffel - 65
Quin - 69
Mambo - 5
Blink - 82
Tech - 9
"Watch as soon as PA gets called, GA AZ and NV all drop their bombs too lol."
Biden needs about 60% of the remaining vote.
"GA is at 99%, there can't possibly be many votes left."
Here we go!
"It’s Perdue* btw

70k!?
That really is unbelievably beautiful
Source?
Sauce?
"Exactly. I don't think Trump supporters can accept that if Biden wins, it was legit. It will fracture their little ego minds."
"I think thats the thing. Trump is like ""wait, why are they leading in these states? We spent so much money to meddle with the votes make sure we win. How dare they be better at cheating that we are?!?!?!"""
"I think it is crazy that Trump believes the Democrats performed election fraud in order to both win the Presidency AND possibly tie the Senate and lose seats in the House. Like, wouldn't you cheat to win everything?"
They've done a lot in the last 4 years on top of existing strategies. Who knows.
Isn't he basically the least significant Trump?
Don Jr just called for war so he might be worse
He's just trying his best to fit in
Link?
gonna need a link for that
"Oh good. That sounds like healthy coping.

Good riddance to these fuckers."
Committing sedition to own the libs
Nevada went from 75% to 76%
"If we get the 140k tonight from the biggest county that will represent about a 1/3 of total remaining, that would be nice"
Have you seen the videos of people counting the ballots?! These are everyday people sitting in front of stacks of ballots in a room together. I feel like they’re playing music and laughing and talking and taking smoke breaks and not really worrying about how crazy the rest of us are!
They don’t want to call it. They’re waiting for PA.
Already are
Without doubt
"Not their entertainment folks (Ingraham, Hannity, Tucker) but their “news” anchors seem pretty done with Trump right now shockingly."
They’re going to try. I think it’s up to all of us to remind everyone that they propped him up.
"Let's not kid ourselves, the only reason they have backed trump is because he is the Republican president.  Fox however has NEVER been a fan of Trump and was quite against him when he was running for President.  Behind closed doors they will be excited to push him away."
Trump might ditch them out of spite anyway because they called AZ early.
Well he'll be their direct competition after he loses so I figure they have to unless they want to work for him.
They already slowly are
I’m thinking more broadly: will the rest of the Republican politicians ditch him if he loses?
There are many signs they don't have a friendly relationship at this point. Unsure what that means going forward though.
Donnie's gonna ditch them and promote OAN and newsmax or whatever that conspiracy network is called...and maybe he'll even start his Trump TV or whatever the hell he wants.
"Gonna be ugly. He’s not loyal to fox. Hell throw more gas on the flames that are already there(Fox News sucks). So if he starts turning viewers against them, they will turn on him as well."
Already did
But the mail-in vote has been breaking more towards Biden than the counties overall right?
I don't think that's enough
There are votes outstanding in heavy D Clayton county. Any info on that?
"Epilepsy warning on that link, holy hell."
How do you download twitter videos?
"That's $0.0100775 each... so if you take 10 seconds to comment at that rate, you're literally adding your 2 cents."
Ga just send me a location.
You clearly have never watched Fox News.
"Push the ""play/pause"" button"
Yes!
I'd be cautious about that 98 percent. It may or may not lag actual votes yet to be counted and also may or may not include votes counted awaiting reporting.
C'mon Georgia make me proud of my home state!
I *still* don’t trust those odds
"betting odds are only around to break even for the casino, meaning 91.7 % of people are betting on biden and 8.3 on trump, thus ensuring a wash for the casino"
Don’t tell me odds!
"Hey, weed is legal is in MA."
Don't forget guns.
Don't forget about marijuana...literally.
The GOP needs to break the fuck away from Trump if they want to survive.
We will absolutely need to prosecute this entire family.
Jonathan Swan has been great lately.
Interesting to see if that can happen when they're behind bars.
Trump has made a mockery of everything good in life.
I believe you are correct.
while wolf interrupts him 20 times
Hahaaahahaa
Ikr. Who does that?
Why?
God that would’ve been perfect
That’s so two thousand and late
I did ;[
I voted on election day because I didn't trust the bullshit shenanigans that I knew republicans would try to pull with early and mail-in votes.
"I did, but I live in a small town.  Like 2 people were there when I voted."
"I believe they are accepting ballots until tomorrow, as long as they were postmarked by Nov.3. So they don't even have the all of the last ballots yet."
"Hey, actually counting the votes is relatively new there.  Give them a chance."
The way he smoothly rolls around the states and different information and doesn't miss a beat is amazing
Well now Toomey is licking Trumps butthole so so maybe it was a threat call.
"And soon, more threads than states."
There are about 100k more votes left than that.
"Needs 65%, totally doable"
*apart from every other democracy which actually functions as a democracy
"It used to be true. Up until probably 40-50 years ago we were leaders in government, now we’re behind in many ways."
Which Repugs?
Where is this lovely circular firing squad going down?
Insane that they can’t see that the useful idiot has run his course and they don’t want to go down sinking with him
"Trapper referred to ""his spawn"" before lol"
"Just waiting for them to say ""his larvae"""
Heard that too and chuckled lol
"The anchor used the phase ""his spawn"" earlier lol."
"""his spawn"""
Tapper referred to them as his “spawn” earlier today. Tapper dont give a fuck lol.
When you're used to getting everything your way the only way you don't is if someone cheats you.
If Trumps presidency taught us anything its that you can literally make up anything you want and lots of people might believe you
"Well yeah, that's what they have been doing for the past 4 years."
I'd like to know if the taxpayers are paying for these frivolous lawsuits?  Isn't the DOJ lawyers filing the lawsuits?
Don't need to. He's not running again.
Hes resigning
"He's retiring, so we don't even get the fucking satisfaction."
Rumor is that he’s announcing that he’s conceding.
It would be glorious to see Fox cut away mid speech/rant to announce Biden has won
"Ah, Dr Crane."
That'd be interesting.
Is it Trump or Trump Jr?
I'm legit scared of what he's going to say at 6:30. I can't even watch. I'll read about it on here.
Going to jail to own the libs?
10-1
dank. up you go.
oh god
he's going to go nuts
"I trust that this will be a measured and reasonable statement about respecting the democratic process, and making sure every vote is counted.

/s"
"Hope for the best, expect the worst.  This is probably (definitly not) a concession.  Most likely he's going to throw more rhetoric and start asking his supports to take to the streets to 'secure the election before it is stolen' or some shit like this.  
  
Let's hope he doesn't incite something that we will all regret."
Is that eastern time?
Let’s go!
Link? last I'm seeing is still over 90k
Even odds he’s going to call for violence from his supporters.
So probably more like an hour given how long he takes to speak...
We need to see Biden take the lead in PA a 6:25pm. Please. Please.
Get your popcorn

"Dude, this was massive. Biden made a Gigantic Gain there"
"Weirdos, im from Ontario and its starting to get cool at night.

">Biden flipped Erie county, PA according to CNN

Who wins Erie wins PA"
"Nice,but meaningless. All that counts is total votes in the state."
utterly maddening
I know where from... his ass.
isn't erie the bellweather county?
If Biden takes Erie that might be enough
Wtf.. sauce?
Maybe they'll blast hail to the chief just like election night
Maybe on Biden’s behalf...
"In my dreams right now it’s a concession and resignation at the same time. Not gonna happen, but wouldn’t it be nice?"
"At this rate, he's going to claim Greenland as part of US by tomorrow."
Why's it so fucking close does America really suck this bad?
"It's not even going to be a nail biter.

Can you and perhaps some of your friends move to Georgia in time for the election in January and vote there?
"Damn, they knew about these last mail-ins leaning Trump? Kinda wild."
"It's ogre, republicans."
I loved how Tapper said that. Just so embarrassed for him.
At least the doggies get to run and have fun.
I wonder if that 2k~ votes are from Pima County
"The President of the United States, everyone. Only a few more months."
Then...what did he want?
He is not a smart man.
">I’m told that on the phone call this morning, Trump said he assumed people knew that by “stop the count” he didn’t mean he wanted to stop the count.

""I was being sarcastic"" 🙄"
God this is insane
"Needing six was counting AZ. He needs 17 from some combination of those 4 states.

PA alone, AZ + NV, or GA plus any other win for Biden for the lowest 270+ counts.

If Biden wins GA but somehow loses the others, it's the fabled 269 tie.

Biden is likely to win PA, AZ, and NV, which would be a nice 290. But they are all close."
"To be clear, he needs 17. The AZ call by Fox and AP was way too early"
He’s not wrong lol
"Funnily enough, Oklahoma also has a Miami pronounced the same way."
Redditors should buy acres of land there and turn it blue.
"looked it up on google maps, that place really is the middle of nowhere."
We need an AMA with those 17 Biden voters.
"\> I have determined that Roberts County of Texas has been deemed the world’s worst place to live   


It is in the Texas pandhandle, so it was going to be near the top of that list regardless of its politics."
As a Texan I'm frankly surprised they had any for Biden
wow not spurpised its my home state
I looked to see where it is and to say it’s in the middle of nowhere is a massive understatement
She is a badass Secretary of State!
Right? She was a very pleasant distraction from all this stress.
There are apparently only 326k votes left to count
"Of you fit an x^2 to that, does it fit the curve better? Just wondering if there's a tapering to the trend, or if it is indeed linear"
"This is solid analysis, thank you! I have also been doing analysis on estimated time Biden would overcome Trump in PA.. it was 8 PM originally (early this morning), pushed to 10pm when it looks like PA vote totals are coming in slow, and I haven't made fresh calculation yet but I am sure it was pushed out further. It appears you got this down to a science though with that chart!"
Alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright

Do something about what?
"There’s no legit legal prescient. If the popular vote was a lot closer than it is now, there would be a case."
That is fucking scummy.
Gives ACB a nice excuse to recuse herself
"They need a reason and evidence to go to the SC. Can't just walk up there and wander in going ""I lost! Fix it!""

Not saying Trump and his idiots won't try though."
Step in how? And for what? Following the law?
"By the time these cases get to the courts, the count will have been finished. Their lawsuits are trying to prevent any ballots that showed up after Election Day from being counted, which wouldn’t be enough to change the lead, as in Pennsylvania and Georgia, those have not been factored into the count, same with Nevada."
At least they finally admit they've been trying to stack the deck.
These people always telling on themselves. What can the supreme court really do?
">It's an outrage that they are in contempt of court

People have defied subpoenas from the House at the direction of Donald, I dunno what they're wailing about."
Aren't elections and results handled state to state? Can the USSC even do anything about it?
What’re they gonna do? Discount valid votes?
Waahhh we gave them jobs its time for them to bend the law for us as a payback for this blatant quid-pro-covid
They will use raw number of submissions as a club. Do not send them anything.
Then again they’ll come out and claim they received “millions of claims of voter fraud” just like they thought millions of people wanted to come to the Tulsa rally

Maybe thy can force him to watch it from his jail cell.
Oh that’s happening
How many lawsuits has he filed there?
I thought he already tried this.
I feel like stopping the count does nothing than delay the actual results but we still need to continue to count every vote
Oh dont worry it'll get thrown out just like in michigan and georgia
Wasn't this the same lawsuit they tried in Michigan and it got thrown out?
They all already have that ability.
"They actually do, they just haven't been an ass and challenge every count, nor are they causing big ruckuses and getting themselves kicked out."

It's what they do.
Because they hate democracy?
...wut?
Massive ego.
"Panic.  Let's try to make sure and follow through with as many of them going to jail as possible if they commit crimes.  ""I was sad about the election"" isn't an affirmative defense for calling for violence."
Also the fact that the senate didn't flip means there's not likely to be any sudden or dramatic changes. I'm guessing the market likes the predictability.
That’s how I’m thinkin.’
Dems can still get control the Senate. Jan 5th runoff election in Georgia.
The Blue wave washed the swamp outta the white house.
Yeah that’s the interesting part. Republicans who hate Trump still went hard for their congressional leaders.
blue wave my ass. Even if biden wins this is a massive L for the dems. Calling republicans racist isnt a winning tactic
They don't realize that the small red wave that helped bolster their downballot candidates were almost certainly due to Trump. He turns out a lot of people who wouldn't otherwise vote and they voted for other Republicans too.
I don’t blame them they have the courts and likely senate they don’t need to bow to his craziness anymore.
Looks like it
"Only route for Trump is to abuse his power as president to screw with the election. Not sure what he could do, but I expect something like trying to get DoJ or NSA involved"
Explain...?
How?
"Based on my math, 3 or 4 more if the trends hold."

15 to 20
Loving twitter’s absolute shut down of all the shit spewing out of trump’s page. It’s glorious.
It would be hilarious if people reported Trump supporters protesting the counting of votes in certain cities.
Sharks have political beliefs now?
"Yep, we need to get him and the woman that translates rap and rock translate every everything.  Maybe they have a showdown, but I don't think the world is ready."
And possibly therapists.
They are definitely forgetting.
Especially a candidate who never stopped campaigning even after he won. That's very unusual.
"Trump is a tour-de-force. He's a moron, and his ""policies"" are beyond trash, but he fires people up like nothing else. Getting any win at all against this guy is something we can celebrate for the rest of our history. Cutting him off early averts one timeline where the entire world spins into hell."
"I think people are saying it’s disappointing because this is not what the Dems projected. For example, we kept hearing of a blue wave in the senate/house. Dems won’t get the senate and they LOST seats in the house. And again, a lot of Dems thought Biden would win handily. So I agree with u, it’s not disappointing in the sense that Biden is close to beating an incumbent President which is very rare. But it’s disappointing in how the Dems thought it would happen."
"Traditionally, sure. It's very difficult for an incumbent president to lose. But not many incumbents were sitting on an ongoing pandemic, 200K+ dead, a severe economic recession, civil unrest with riots in the streets, all in one term. The fact that it's even close is an embarrassment to the American electorate."
"Saved this for later, thanks!"
"Nice! Never heard of it, so thanks for the recommendation."
Thanks always looking for good brit mysteries!
"Jesus, seriously 😂. That's like a pensioners show over here. It's a prequal series to a detective show called ""morse"" if you wanted a background watch. It also has a contemporary show (with morse's old partner) called ""Lewis"".

My mum and dad watch it all the time :)"
"I watched four seasons before I learned it’s the prequel to the old Inspector Morse series, which I’d heard of but never seen. But that explains why they set the show in the ‘60s."
What streaming service is it on?
It’s based on “Morse” which is also highly worth watching (and reading!)
What’s it on? Sounds interesting
Hope he doesn't have a heartarrack or stoke when he finds out he lost
That golden toilet is taking the worst punishment of its life.
"Some greasy ass burgers sounds pretty good right now, ngl"
"His kids have lost the plot completely.

They are seeing prosecution on the horizon."
that oval office carpet will have so many crumbs squashed in there.
just check Scott Presler on Twitter
Me too!
Trump after learning Biden's transition site was live. https://m.imgur.com/ztTeEyh

"Saw someone post this: https://twitter.com/RightWingWatch/status/1324175651515949056?s=20

Saved it but haven't watched it cuz work."
What does this mean?
Even if they were all dqd I don't think Trump can overcome the deficit after just the ones arriving by day of.
Yeah I thought that was a crock of shit when he said it but I couldn't remember with 100% certainty. I'm surprised nobody called him out on it on TV. They have to call this shit out every time and not dance around the wording.
And Nikki Haley is gunning for president. The fallout from this election will be interesting.
Both posturing for 2024 run
Let them fight!
They really are the worst kind of people.
"Oh God he actually put ""sad!""

Some of these Republicans are so inauthentic. Adopting Trump Twitter language is, for lack of a better word, sad!"
Me too. I'm wired but tired.
They’re going to start to eat themselves. It’s going to be amazing TV
What happened with Graham?
Let them fight
This is hilarious!

That was like strolling through an insane asylum"
[deleted]
They have *a lot* of manpower to count.
"Hahaha good question.

And how tf do you guys do it with like 16 different parties to choose from?"
Their election is five weeks long.
Electronic I think
"They only let certain caste's vote 

/s"
"They count more than 20 ballots nationally in a minute, I'm guessing."
Electronic systems not paper ballots
"Their system may be a bit cruder or more straightforwards/less gameable.

US system is fairly complicated I believe by world standards. In the UK I only ever vote for one party and one candidate at the same time apart from occasional local elections. The Prime Minister and local MP etc can't be voted for separately on a general election."
"Parliamentary systems are a fuck sight easier than this, even if the FPTP flaws carry over."
"In a lot of places you vote and at that particular station they do a count and report the numbers, quickly. So the main wide electoral office gets these reports from all over the little stations around the city/state. They add them up and post the results, usually that same night. And then they start counting. Because there's no electoral college, differences don't come down to one particular county. It's just most votes win type of election. It could be close or not, but it's not a ""this county decides the presidency"", it's just votes."
It takes them like a month. And it’s over seven phases
Fucking good point.
really good call center support staff
India doesn't have significant mail in ballots.No early voting. All electronic machines. National election happens on 6-7 days spanning a month. Counting starts 8AM after few days of final election day. Results are clear in few hours.
They’re not even talking about the election lol. They must be in complete deny. Like a kid hiding behind their hand. You can’t see me if I can’t see you
Republican who abstained this time around chiming in. Sounds about right
I can't stand the dude that sits on the far right. So annoying.
You think they’d be happy. Their audience thrives on anger and they get a lot of that when their opposition is in the White House. Probably good for their ratings..
I have no idea how the people on CNN still manage to find time to breath.
"""Lost"". The past tense of losing is ""Lost"""
What are they saying?
Why?
Ive written him a couple nasty emails
Nevada is basically me at work this entire week.
I'm all for a bi partisan investigation into NV. Absolutely unacceptable
Shit dude we are real sorry. This is absolutely egregious and you can feel the tension out here in Vegas.
"Nevada is counting every ballot post marked by Election Day, regardless of how slow USPS is moving. Thank DeJoyKiller."
They are going to give morning updates. Final tally is after all ballots can come in.
Called them spawns earlier
Pennsylvania SoS said they will probably have enough counted to call a winner tonight. They have counted more than reported as well
No
Probably not. Maybe Georgia but not 100%
Biden will pull ahead in PA sometime after midnight
The only state that we could possibly get a result from tonight is Georgia
"Nope. 

But hopefully Biden will flip either PA or GA tonight. Once that happens, everything else is just gravy."
I think we’re getting blue balled again.
"Maybe PA, maybe GA, that's it"
Fuck. I hate that guy
I was getting so frustrated watching that. You can't think of any reason why people shouldn't be getting closer than 6 feet? Really? And furthermore.. people can very much see what's going on from six feet away.
They don’t trust their own lying ears and eyes.
"To be fair, it's been a long time since a Republican got through their first term without starting a major conflict."
Yeah he only assassinates Iranian generals.
"just reading that he's scheduled to speak has filled me with anxiety.   


There's no limit to his depravity - everything he says will be a spark shouted at a powderkeg."
"He can't stop it through the courts, so he'll use his nutjob supporters instead. Straight out of the fascist playbook"
You think we'll get a stream of swearing from him? God that would be amazing
Meltdown incoming
"God what I wouldn't do to be there and secretly smuggle in a Clown Horn to ""Honk"" every now and again durring his speech.

EDIT: Or better still! The long drawn-out sound of a balloon deflating! =D"
Is this in PA?
"So my mental maths says Biden needs around 256K of those for a bare minimum victory, which is... around 60%? Maybe I've gone wrong somewhere, not carried a digit or something, but I'm still hopeful."
Subscribed
Don’t forget that if a lot of those are mail in ballots that even if they are from red counties mail in ballots have tended to be heavily democratic
"I don't know, but thank you."
"You're counting the same votes twice mate, 80-90% of them are already in the 'Current Votes' tally. There's not 2.6M votes remaining, more like 600k.

Disregarding Biden getting a higher percentage of mail-ins, he would be expected to gain 34% of 131k votes in Cuyahoga (~45k), not 250k..."
What the fuck?
Ohio is around 3m votes for Trump and 2.5m votes for Biden with 90% reporting according to NYT. Wouldn't Biden have to nearly sweep the last half million?
"that whale almost eating those women was wild tho...
 /s"
GOP will say hes 'obviously joking'
GOP been mostly sitting this whole thing out so far. Haven't really heard much from them.
I like how they say approximately but give an exact number.
"So basically, Biden just needs 60% of those remaining ballots and he should win Georgia handedly."
What's the split on that?
I have a feeling this will be called after midnight
"Yeah, little worried this is where he goes full mask off and tries to pull something big. I'm sure it'll be dumbass rambling and whining like usual, but still. Kinda concerned"
It’s trump... I doubt it.
That was the question with AZ was the biggest county was likely to come in a bit red but would it be enough to push trump past the deficit he has there. Hard to say currently though.
Maybe just 5 minutes before
They can’t see where the votes come from. They just see the dump and panic.
"atm Trump is on pace to win back AZ, just barely. https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html"
"I used to live in AZ, and the specter of Joe Arpaio will haunt me forever."
I live in Gaetz district.  My county went nearly 42% for Biden.
"Same, omg. it's looking like Biden's winning, but until it's official I'm not gonna be able to rest easy lol."
It'll be 3 more months of this nonsense.
Dude samee
I agree. I just want to go back to when we used to get a break from nonstop politics until election year.
Don't check out until Biden is inaugurated. It's not over until it's over.
Same looking forward to the detox
He might announce Trump 2024
He can't just masturbate like the rest of us.... 🙄
So you're in the perfect state of mind to deal with all of this!
You're qualified to be trump's lawyer. Put on a jacket and you're gtg.
Lmao least you can still reddit
sending chill vibes
Rookie... 😂😎
Goodnight sweet prince
Oh no!
"Night night, green out time."
"Things Trump won't say for $500, Alex"
Absolutely not. Especially not when Biden hasn't solidified a win yet. Narcissists don't just give up.
" ""I officially concede the election to President Biden... NOT!

See, Rudy, I saw the movie!

Now, my Executive Order. I am King. King King King. Bip Bip Boop Boop.

Hey, mini-me, bump me!""

- Donald J Trump"
Big yikes.
"One of them is my best friend, it really sucks but I don't think people realize just what they are doing when they vote for him."
What the fuck is up with Trump supporters and having the attention span of a goldfish? He's disgusted by this press conference and not the past year's mishandling and misinformation about COVID? The past 4 years??
Better late than never !
Was he in a coma for the last 4 years?
shittt

"10k in Forsyth though, it's gonna be so fucking tight."
"OMG, I didn't know Cooper had that level of brutality in him. Someone should check to make sure Trump is still alive after that one."
Santorum is torn because theres the GOP and the Trump party and right now simply being GOP is not good enough to win or possibly be relevant. This is the culmination of years (decades?) of the Republican party not reigning in the crazies and now they're in this mess.
Lol if the GOP doesent think it’s chained to this orange piece of shit  for life they haven’t been paying attention
The final votes are gonna be a bit tight. We got Clayton and Gwinnett blue and Forsyth red.
Does that 19k figure include all votes or will there be any more?
I think the GA SOS said there are still military votes.
Source pls?
"Honestly, Stacey deserves to be the DNC Chair.  She understands how to organize, mobilize, and galvanize democrats.  What she did in Georgia is absolutely astounding."
She was even in FL like last week
Jim Clyburn too for helping him with the primary in SC
Omg omg omg omg
Not tied by votes yet though. Soon hopefully!
Still 49.4 to 49.3 on AP
Fuckin' a!

Jocelyn Benson

Clark County guy really didn’t want to go over those numbers again haha.
Yes! He was sassy!
"Saw a tweet on Election Day that went something along the lines of ""And today, 50 Secretaries of State woke up hoping that entire world didn't know their names at the end of the day."""
"Pretty much every major city in the South voted for Biden, though."
He's gonna take Georgia and Penn and Donnie McBitch needs both or he loses.
Lol of it turns blue I'll switch places with a Republican who wants to move to a red state! 100% volunteer as tribute
She rocked that conference!
Who
More than half of us are decent people. We knew this in '16 when Clinton won the popular vote.
"There are totally normal and educated Americans.

And then there are these other 68 mio..."
what's sad is i can see this as an article in /r/nottheonion
Haha I was thinking that too
"Man she is dumber than a box of rocks.

I had to cute the presser off because she didn't know the answers to questions she should have. Look she's in charge of elections for the state she should easily have the answers and she was just speculating on some of the questions. How the fuck does she not know how every county is handling counting is beyond me."

Democrats spent the pandemic learning WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY and now they're SUMMONING BALLOTS out of THIN AIR oh GOD
"Democrats are rightfully more scared of Covid and so avoid voting in person.

They wanted to get their ballots in advance and make sure it was counted."
-insert surprised Pikachu face-
"Absolutely puzzling.

&#x200B;

/s"
"A theory, just a theory here. Biden supporters are largely bigger cities, with larger/denser populations. That would mean waiting hours in line, especially during covid. Biden supporters that are older especially mailed in their votes to avoid long line ups in larger, heavily populated cities because of covid. It’s just my theory."
"don't know if you're trolling or not but:

Trump supporters generally don't believe in masks or covid. They vote by actually submitting votes themselves.

Biden supporters would rather mail in their votes to be safe and not be in the public."
What'd you do??
Aw :)
I love her too! Cheers!
"You’re not married, get some sleep man.  (Just kidding)"

this changes the game
I love your wife too.
Was it a battleground issue or like Biden in Cali?
Still too early to call
"What’s weird is that if Biden ends up getting NV, AZ, PA, and GA. It will have looked a bit like a landslide. Especially if he somehow flips NC. This could still end up looking like a bit of a landslide as close as it is lol."

"We've got some stuff to sort out over here, ok?"
"FWIW a lot of us are just as mortified by it as you are. I'm legit trying to convince my partner we should look at immigrating (to Canada or Europe) in the next decade. It's something I've thought about for a long time but not very seriously...after seeing the votes pour in for Trump the last few days, I am now giving it much more serious consideration."
It's called electoral college and it has nothing to do with education :'(
"That's like around 20% of our population which tracks for the quotient of crazy people that a given country is going to have. For context, Duterte, who openly murders his own citizens in the Philippines, won with 16%. Would have had way more in a two party system too. Canada votes for the most coked out guy with the last name Ford that they can find whenever they're given a chance. Frankly, around a quarter of every country is a bunch of idiots."
How many ballots left?? I think Trump is gonna win Georgia
Yea counties between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh is Pennsyltucky.  I mean who would of thought rednecks and city slickers would have different ideals?
"It's always been that way. When you live in a city it forces you to interact with a variety of different people and idea.

When you live in a town of 900 it doesn't."

After all the old people he sacrificed to the economy this is how it repays him? :(
Dow is up 1.9%
You mean Wisconsin started the slow clap.
"I think they're waiting on GA or PA, because those states are close. They don't want to call it with NV since it would put AZ in question, but if GA comes around first, they'll call it with NV."
"If that's true, that's stupid. States should be autonomous and run on their own rules, independent of what other states are going through."
I was watching ABC earlier and Jon Karl said that Hannity might have to be the person to tell Trump he lost
I would pay good money....
Oh I’m gonna use this one
Sweet Georgia keep me alive
do you know how many votes left to count in GA?
[removed]
Maybe both or maybe neither. Tough to say.
PA -no. GA - here's hoping.
"GA probably, PA who the fuck knows. If PA flips for Biden he's basically won though."
Georgia is more likely to call today. Nevada around thanksgiving maybe.
They won’t call it until it’s 100% (if even then). Way too close
Ain't gonna call it until he is in the lead and we know it is statistically impossible for Trump to come back.
"GA is going to be insanely close. Whoever wins, it might be by less than 1000 votes."
Its possible that neither get the majority. I think that results in a runoff.
At 530 there's two press conferences. We'll have some fat to chew from those. Hopefully.
"Get the popcorn ready if that’s the case, Trump camp will absolutely fucking lose their minds if anyone calls PA while he still leads."
I thought the injunction stopped all counting today
"I would make them now, it's not too late. AZ and NV makes us wait a day then releasing like 500 votes and calling it a day again."
"More than that, he should grant them residency for the abuse and suffering they underwent."
I thought I heard that he stated that recently...
Please! And find the parents!!
"I'm willing to treat him like an inept butler who keeps getting my tea wrong *the second* he's in power.

We must remember they're supposed to be civil servants, not celebrities."
Pls dont give him ideas.
quite true if % splits of remaining votes remain similar to current averages of recent vote drops
"Yup she knows that they stole the election she can hardly stop smiling and can breathe she's so giddy. 

/s F45"
"Yeah, she looks happier than people usually do anymore."
Pretty sure trump has ASL’d? a few times
"Trump did sign language that one time for that reporter, remember?"
ha!  Good point.
Man what would that job even be like? Imagine trying to interpret his speech on the fly?
I don't think so. Trump thinks it makes him look dumb.
I thought that's what trump waiving his hands around was for?
lol good one
I'm not sure there are many interpreters for moron to ASL.
"That’s a pre-existing condition, so no."
I don't think they can because of his garbled nonsensical speak.
"Maybe if an interpreter tried to sign “pull yourself up by your bootstraps,” it would highlight what a ridiculous saying it is."
"> citing vague and unsupported claims of cheating

The Republican MO."
Not even surprised. What a POS.
"You know, it's funny how Republicans cry about not conceding when they lose, while they attacked Hillary for waiting a few hours on election night to concede, and then acted like Hillary never conceded in the first place. They're all such hypocrites. They lost this election, maybe not how we expected them to lose, but they lost and they need to accept it."
Good luck bud
The dementia will have heavily set in by then
How's he going to run from a jail cell?
It’s really difficult to run for office from jail.
lol he's gonna be in prison by then. good luck trump
Be hard to run from a prison cell....
Yikes. Why can't he just go away and take a nice vacation on the other side of the world or something?
Run for what? President of the prison commissary?
Hopefully as an independent
I wonder how he'll be able to run from prison...
"Fine, just get the fuck out right now. I trust McDonald's to handle the rest."
"Wow such a historic moment, the first felon candidate."
I hope he runs as an independent.
Someone want to tell him to go ahead and concede?
Going to be difficult to do that from prison.
"He just wants to keep being able to campaign, take donations, and grift off them."
No god please no! Please just be indicted and disappear
Gotta run from the FBI first
Oh he's going to stay in the US? That's bold.
Oh god please make the pain stop.
"NY is biting at the bit to get him behind bars, so we'll see."
If he’s alive in 2024 I’ll eat my hat. He’s in the worst shape and he eats like a drunk college student. Not to mention I think he’s gonna be a bit preoccupied the next few years.
Mail ins or total?
That’s just Philly not all of PA

Pennsylvania
It’s PA. Give me your money. It’s always been PA.
PA when it's called around midnight
PA.
"Pennsylvania, no doubt. Once it surpasses trump it will be called"
Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania
I think AZ will seal it tonight.
"PA, in a couple hours"
PA
PA
PA!
We know it won’t be Nevada since fox already called Arizona early and don’t want to break the news to their viewers... my guess Pennsylvania
It would be amazing if it was Georgia.
Penn.
Hmm Penn.
"*Nevada*

Since you talk about bets. I wanna win big. Really big."
NV
"Coming from an Australian who's only been looking at the live results from Google, my guess would be either Georgia (assuming they go blue) or Nevada. If no
Georgia doesn't go blue, Nevada seems like the next likely option to me. But I'm an Aussie with very little knowledge of U.S politics, so I can't say anything with certainty. 

But seriously, what are the odds of Trump winning every uncalled state?"
PA for sure.  He's going to be over 100k up by the looks of it after all the votes are counted.  That's indisputable and recount won't help.

website is down! i tried.
"I acknowledge it every day, him and Limbaugh are like bonnie and clyde"
"It's taken this long before. Hell, it took several weeks to know who won in 2000, and we never even actually learned that because SCOTUS intervened to proclaim the election for Bush."
"It usually takes this long to count all the votes, and they count them all anyway.  But it usually isn't so close that we have to wait for so many states to completely finish."
Doing God's work.
"My fiancee always says we should have elected his brother. Sockett.

Tough but fair.
How did they not expect this?
48 hours? I'm used to this shit being 3 hours max.
At this rate we might know by the midterm
325k left. Mostly mail-ins.
what the fuck
Yes he did. You can find the video on Twitter.
"Yes, the video is floating around on Twitter."
"Yup. Somebody else linked it way down below, not sure if I can find it again though"
yes.. [https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1324481449614024715](https://twitter.com/DrEricDing/status/1324481449614024715) sadly
Kind of questionable why he wouldn't share the video...
"We don't know because the doofus making the claim isn't citing sources.


Just fucking give half your paycheck to Joel Osteen if you want to believe sourceless bloviating so badly. Like if you're just gonna buy into a narrative like that on pure faith, why not just arbitrarily believe whatever you want at that point?"
"“I’m not gonna show the video but...” look, I hate these people too but you at least need to give us some proof."
"Looks like it

https://twitter.com/peltzmadeline/status/1324471538310127618"
well close - he said he wanted their heads on a pike - he wants scorched earth if trump loses
"Yes I’ve seen several
People I follow on Twitter confirm it"
"Why didn't he post the video, seems sus maybe imp"
I'm trusting Favs on this one

Nothing but the finest people
Yes
Can’t stop watching
Good
Talking about Trump 2024 and how great it is that Trump broke everything.
they're worried they're gonna look like idiots if arizona goes the wrong way too :P serves them right for reporting ap's reports instead of their own. find your own source sheeeet.
"
I can make it for you right now “I DECLARE VICTORY!  BIDEN IS CHEATING! VOTER FRAUD! STOP THE VOTE!”"
Concession hopefully.
"Odds he’s gonna rant about unfairness, fraud and say he quitting? 

I’m fully expecting him to start demanding his followers to attach the ballot counting places. Gonna be fun to see how Fox News handles being the site avocations for a civil war."
It’s insufferable.   They are just filling dead air.
"That's why I prefer MSNBC. They don't often have the trump pundits on to lie incessantly. CNN likes to do the ""both sides"" thing. Fuck that. One side lies constantly and supports a fascist oompaloompa. The other side is not republican."
It’s going to be one hell of a shitshow
6:30 eastern?
Holy cow. Really?
"Looking good, how many outstanding?"
"Yeah Biden is up like 3.6m in popular vote right now, but still millions to be counted in CA and other states. I bet he’ll win the popular vote by like 6-7m after everything has been counted"
"Trump: The votes for me are perfect and should only be counted.  The votes for my opponent are all tainted, fraudulent, and should be immediately tossed out."
"No way, his ego won't allow it."
"Looks like you dont know him well. If anything, he will declare he win the second time."
I firmly believe every state could be blue on the projected maps and he *still* wouldn't concede. I literally just cannot see him doing so whatsoever.
Trump's gunna quit and start his own country!
I wonder if they are even allowing him anywhere near the TV right now.  Probably knocked him out with some drugs.
"Honestly, he shouldn't yet and I'd say the same if this Biden in his position. It's close. Trump still can win. It's too early for either to concede, though the odds lean towards Biden."
70%
great numbers for Biden in Harrisburg of all places
"That's crazy, Cumberland is R+11 at the moment. Looks like the ""don't vote by mail"" message really got out to Trump's supporters."
"I mean, in fairness, that's not the worst thing. This has been 72 hours of hell."
They've gone to showing clips of cute animals lmao
Back to car chases?
What are they talking about? Assume this is a good sign?
"Good?

Is there really more to talk about until we get more numbers for real?"
Are they showing car crashes?
Easy
Question is how many votes are left to make up that margin?
"That would be even more late considering that right now, Perdue is heading for a runoff."
"He'll try, and what's scary is they just might do it..."
Luckily he would be laughed off the stage.  Nobody is going to war for his ego alone.  There simply isn't enough evidence of any shenanigans for open revolt.

Agreed. It'll be late in the night probably but I think Biden wins tonight

Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.

I've got knots in my stomach and I'm not even over there.
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
"No he didn't, he just [prepared the letter](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/long-odds-trump-defense-secretary-esper-has-prepared-resignation-letter-n1245846?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma):

> It's not uncommon for Cabinet secretaries to prepare undated letters of resignation during a presidential transition, giving the commander in chief the chance to replace them for a second term. The president decides whether to accept the resignation letters, and the process usually occurs after the election results are clear.

> But defense officials say Esper prepared his letter because he is one of the Cabinet officials long expected to be pushed out after the election."
Defense sec resigned?? Whats going on....?
hehe
"You should see what some conservatives are saying about MI and WI.. ""iT's nOT fAiR tHat BIg CiTieS CaN ConTroL tHe RuAl aReas"""
PA matters more than any other state and Biden is making up ground fast.
it would be in a forum format.
I dont like hearing his voice so I have it muted. Whats he saying?
Fantastic.
Thats pretty much it. Dont believe a word he says. Its all a lie and unsubstantiated bullshit.
Just gotta know where those last votes are gonna come from and if we blew through all the blue counties.
They're cutting the cord.
Absolutely

That was great.
They did not.
No
Nope.
No. We just held marches and mads protests around the country in major cities.
"No, but if you asked them they'd tell you it was all unemployed antifa, evil dems, soros-funded psychos setting fire to everything every day."
"No.


There was a lot of social media push to recount in the upper Midwest, but those vote margins were so much closer than they are this year. 


Jill Stein even requested a recount."
"Oh no, they’d have been executed. Can’t even go to vote without getting pepper sprayed apparently"
No
"Democrats broke down in tears and wore pussy hates, Republicans mald and get violent lol."
Nope. People were mostly just devastated not angry. Angry too but no one said he rigged it to my recollection.
Nope.
Yeah they just went out into the streets and wailed and freaked the heck out.
Nope
I do believe a lot of them put on funny pink caps and wandered around Washington D.C.
No and you better believe most won't spend 4 years gloating like children because there is actual work that needs to get done.
"No, they did not."
"No, they (I definetly could be called a Democrat but don't like to identify with either party so call me what you want)  got upset about it but did they do Maga militia type stuff? Of course not, Democrats aren't insane."
"No. But it's a replay of the 2000 Republican ""Brooks Brothers Riot"" in Florida. Sigh."

"It'll take awhile, but with only 79K at 89% in... Jesus. Biden closed the gap by hundreds of thousands with only 3-ish percent of that 13% of oustanding mail-in ballots. Trump should lose, but I'm not resting until Biden is definitively the winner."
When’s he gonna speak
We're the rabbit in this scenario. Biden is the fox 😂
Fox being the first one to call it
"You're about to owe a lot of people $20 my dude, PA definitely won't get called tonight"
If you’re right I’ll give you $20
A better bet is that Biden will take the lead in Penn by tonight

"I’m proud of Bucks County too, I was a bit worried I went to school with some of these people"
Four too many.
Either side only needs 1
"I know it says 27, but I only see 7 ways on that page. 27 is way too much. 

1. PA
2. NC & GA
3. GA & AZ
4. GA & NV
5. NC & AZ
6. NC & NV
7. AZ & NV"
Which are?
They would win.
Are you really sure about that? Trump bullshit is what has energized their base so much
"No they wouldn't, they'd lose their core supporters. They **are** the party of white grievance politics."
So in other words purge the infection that is trumpism?
Hey! No one asked for a reasonable way to run a party here. GOP run extremes only now!
"Yeah there's no money you can make with that, compared to the corrupt shit now."
"I don’t know, man, I think that’s their appeal unfortunately."
But then they wouldn't be the GOP :(
"Conservative politics has a legitimate place in the world, it's the undertones that ruin it."
"The fact that we’re where we are right now shows me they are doing just fine. I agree with you though, being ACTUALLY fiscally responsible would get them farther into the moderates and independents"
arguably that's exactly where they were before Trump and adding those views to the platform increased their base....
Many human beings are just waiting for someone to tell them that it's okay to hate and blame others for their misery.
"That we got where we are fills me with shame.  But that we appear (for now) to have pulled back from the brink without need for outside, forceful intervention, gives me a little pride."
"This is just the start. Based on this election, there is a high chance of the nazis coming back again in 2024.

Remember, we are still doing horribly with the pandemic. Without dealing with it, economy will not recover.

The GOP senate will do everything in their power to prevent Biden from fixing this.

You would think that should cost them voters, but apparently not. Those who voted for Trump this year will see it as a major political victory."

"Yeah with how poorly the youth vote showed up *again*, I feel like Bernie would probably have done even worse considering how much the older generation is scared of “socialism.”  I say that as a Bernie supporter in the primary too."
"And it's pretty difficult to unseat incumbents, regardless of how bad they are, so the fact that Biden might win is pretty significant."
Same. This election really opened my eyes to how completely fucked this country is when it comes to political discourse. The GOP would have a field day with Bernie. The propaganda networks they control are way too powerful.
"Yeah, I love Bernie, but he wouldn't be pulling these numbers."
"I wish we could just see alternates universes where each primary candidate wins. I'm happy with Biden, but i just wonder how the rest would've done"
"I am a big Bernie fan but seeing how this is shaking out, there's no way he could've won. As much as I personally dislike it, Biden was the best chance of beating Trump imo."
"Bernie was polling better than Biden against Trump t
tho."
I think the market likes the prospect of Biden president with Republican senate.
“BiDenS BaD fOr THe MArKet”
Yep my stocks keep going up up up
I think that is more so due to the Senate not changing hence better for corporations. Not so much because of Biden winning.
"the Dow being up more then anything has to do with the likelihood of no party controlling both chambers of congress and the presidency, lack of control over all 3 means no drastic changes"

Yes. He needs to take the remaining mail-in ballots by about 61% and he has consistently been getting 67-70%
Needs 60% and been getting 70%
Yes he needs 60% of what's left to count and is getting 70% of it on average. It will be stupid close. Like recount territory.

No he will just blame Hillary.

He’ll be a quivering pile of goo by 2024.

Black voters unifying and flexing their muscle most likely
Despite the GOP efforts to disenfranchise the big city areas still fought through and voted. Especially minority areas that were fucked the hardest
Black vote.
"Atlanta's doing well in the film and tech industries, bringing in a lot of people who lean more liberal."
Atlanta showed up to the polls
Stacy Abrams
Less old people
Greater Atlanta demographics
Coronavirus swept through rural Georgia and decimated the segregated-prom crowd?
"Atlanta, is rapidly growing. They have a large educated black middle class and in general large African American population."
Old white rich racist people dying
Black people.
Stacy Abrams.
Stacey Abrams
The current president is an asshole and a racist.
"Growing urban and suburban populations, combined with the huge ground game improvement (largely thanks to Stacey Abrams)"
PEOPLE SHOWED UP and STOOD UP to all that gerrymandering and voter suppression-that’s why the GOP doesn’t like when people vote
Atlanta and Stacey Abrams
I assume high population growth in Atlanta
That is a great question. Thought it would be another 10-15 years. I'm loving it!!
"More people coming from blue states, younger population becoming more active, ATL is growing alot and hugely liberal. Anecdotally I know lots of middle class moderates / romney esque Republicans who stayed home or voted biden."
"Black vote as well as a huge influx of people moving here from neighboring college cities (young population) and from more expensive cities from Cali/NY.

I personally know about 5-10 people who have moved here in the last 8 months from either of those states."
"It’s happening in a lot of southern states, albeit slowly. They’ve spent years attracting business from around the country with low taxes and other incentives. This pulls in people from more liberal coastal and northern states. I predict we’ll see a political flip between the north and south within the next 10-20 years. The rust belt is dying, while the south is booming."
Changing demographics and higher turnout from the urban and surrounding areas which are predominantly democratic.
"Trump was the worst President in the history of America and got a quarter of a million people killed through deliberate inaction, that might have had something to do with it"
The short answer is demographics. The longer answer is look into voter suppression during the 2018 elections [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/19/georgia-governor-race-voter-suppression-brian-kemp](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/19/georgia-governor-race-voter-suppression-brian-kemp)
Crooked Republicans doing shit to lose the confidence of the voters.
Black people is the answer.
"GA went blue for Kennedy, Carter and Clinton... so I don’t know about “historically.”"
Black vote in ATL and Stacy Abrams fought to have their votes counted after the Gov election was stolen
College educated people flooding into Atlanta for years from other southern states has been one of the major factors. Lots of grads from places like Ole Miss who want to leave conservative af Mississipi. Also a large black turnout in Atlanta.
Stacy Abrams showed up
"People had babies in Atlanta more effectively than people in rural Georgia, and voter suppression is actually quite hard when someone has no real way to be excluded except race. If enough black voters aren't felons, born slaves or to people born slaves, etc, you just can't really ban them from voting the way old fashioned ""oh your dad needed to be a citizen at birth (which obviously slaves weren't)"" bullshit. 

Add Atlanta growing nicely, especially things like the film industry that brings in more liberal types, and you've got this very liberal hub within a deep red state"
"I think this will be looked into a lot post election. Based on what I gather, Georgia  and Arizona are very similar in that they both have some of the fastest growing metro areas in the US - Atlanta & Phoenix, which tend to be more liberal. Not sure on the overall impact, but Obama campaigned in Georgia leading up to the election. Combine that with record turnout and 2 Senate Seats up for grabs in the same year and that may help explain it. Not to mention, the 2018 Governor Race (Kemp vs Abrams) that was extremely close and dubious in nature, which helped energize the election turnout."
Voter suppression finally went too far and the rubber band snapped. This is the beginning of the recoil.
Stacy Abrams and John Lewis
Stacey Abrams.
"Stacey Abrams is a God-damned Warrior Phoenix Samurai from the Dimension X with ice powers and the ability to fly and the ovaries to give birth to suns (yes, with a ""u"")."
"The margin in GA will be so small for so long, and PA's numbers are trending towards a Biden win so quickly, that PA is all but guaranteed to be called first."
Yes!
"Millions of ballots, ballots for me"
"I want him to narrate my chances of getting to work on time, on a light-by-light basis"
It's a loan.  Not some horrible communists trying to take your country.
Fuck this made me laugh so hard

yeah I think they realize that the trump supporters are going to be rioting and threatening poll workers and the people counting once PA flips.

"Someone needs to clarify what ""To be counted"" and ""votes remaining"" means. Because there can be that many needed to be counted but more that need reported, or those can be all reported and thats it. Just fucking confusing."
"326k

https://www.votespa.com/About-Elections/Pages/Counting-Dashboard.aspx"
Commenting so I can refresh the page and not lose this in the wave of new comments
Wondering the exact sam thing.
"Could be both, counted and reported arent the same."
"Honestly, at this point it doesn't even matter. Biden is poised to win PA at either."
"It's because one is referencing mail in ballot counts, and one is referencing overall counts (because there's still like, one or two precincts in PA that haven't reported -at all-"
"Counted and reported are different. Secretary of State said 326k to be counted, but there are 430k votes left. So they can report 100k of those at any time.

It means there could be 100k coming at any time."
There’s a different between left to be counted and left to be reported
It depends on who has the accurate estimate of vote left to be counted.
Use this platform to raise awareness to Harambe!
Waluigi about to claim for not being in Smash
Just submitted as Bender Bending Rodriguez
"Don't know, but looks like PA definitely is!"
"Its going to be really close, like literally could come down to 100's of votes. They think they'll be done counting tonight, but you never know."
Trending that way yes
If we do I'm nutting so hard it punches a hole in my drywall and starts an electrical fire.
who knows.
hope so
Hope so!
Maybe. We’ll see. It’s looking like it might.
I really don’t think there will be one. He just won’t read it.
"He will never give a concession speech, id bet money."
I really can't fathom him making a concession speech
GA is using paper ballots for the first time in 20 years supposedly which is why it's taking so long
"They are one of the few outlets to call AZ for Biden, they will be a tight spot if NV goes to Biden because that will give Biden 270."
"I lasted 30 seconds. 

oh now they fighting, that is better"
They will call it first

"They've always been the loud minority, I haven't met a trump supporter that hasn't shut fuck up"
He's probably gonna push his voter fraud propaganda. Eric and Jr have been doing that since past few house and his maga nutcased too. He'll also blast GOP for being silent and blah blah

"I still 100% expect Trump to start a media network after he's out of office, whether that's January or four years from now. I think his first run started as a publicity grab, and a platform to point out the problems he saw in media coverage and see how many other people felt the same way, and his long game was the business move of filling the hole he saw in the market. He just ended up winning, delaying that. Which is why he's gradually moved to be more and more frustrated with fox News even."
Well he said he didn't want to be there.
Was it supposed to go to Trump?
He will never do that.  He’s going to have to be dragged out in January.

Eww yuck gross. Really?
Yep :-)
Direct deposit homie
Mine never showed up.
"Yep, I'm getting a new bed with it!"
Still waiting on mine
Think mine's in that dude's trunk.
"No, but I'm trying to negotiate for more Soros Bucks^TM given the pending GA run-off(s)."
Im buying a ps5 with the first soros check but i haven't decided what to do with the second soros check yet
Shoulda asked for BTC.
I'm still waiting for mine from the Women's March back in 2017. Good luck.
She fuckin knows lol
Yup it's obvious
Why would he be?
"Not only that, do you really think a lame duck president such as Trump will expend the effort to campaign for someone else?


No. If he did, he’d go there and whine."
Sooo much money is about to be absolutely DUMPED into GA for the runoff.
And a lot of trump voters might be ready pissed at everything
Good point. In any case this is going to require a massive get out the vote effort.
"Yeah, even better if Biden wins Georgia and even better if he wins the presidency."
I pointed that to another user. Along with the fact that Dems now know that Georgia can go blue.
That probably hurts Democratic turnout more than GOP. They’re going to be mad as hell as come out in droves.
Can you elaborate? Why would a president be on the ballot for a senate race?
Trump is not running for Senate
Chatham county also isn't updating until tomorrow I think?
"Dunno, might be just short on some states. Like few hundreds short"
\*Screeching at a pitch only dogs should hear intensifies\*
"GA won't be called until next week, I'm afraid. There's military ballots and other ballots to count still and with the 1-2K vote split, they're almost definitely going to have to factor those in."
"Results in PA have slowed though, I dont see Biden breaking even tonight. Would anyone call it with Trump still in the lead even though its pretty obvious that Biden will win?"
Trump's lead in PA is down to 90k per AP.
If Biden wins PA tonight it is game over
I'd bet GA goes to a recount with how close it is
"Allegheny, which is the city of Pittsburgh, won't count tonight."
It's insane. As if a person disagreeing with somebody else automatically means they're going to dismantle our country's most sacred institution.
The nerve to bring up tweets !
What is PA SOS?
cos they have nothing else
He belongs in prison. What’s wrong with his face?
"DISTURBING someone arrest him please, this guy is issuing threats and if I were one of the people being threatened charges would be pressed on him"
Dude.. FBI needs to go ahead and round his ass up.
its all they have left in the tank now
I hope there's something that pig can be put in prison for.
"Wait, how is he STILL not in jail????"
I am very afraid of a lot of right wing violence over the next several years
Good God
I heard the truck had a Biden foundation sticker as a license plate
But was the mechanic legally blind?

"Ah thread 21, was a simpler time"
Haha. Maybe they’re just trying to catch up!
He must’ve taken a wrong turn at Albuquerque.
It happens this thread goes deep
"Dude, you can't respond to him here!"
"I thought there was a thread 23 party earlier.  At this rate, we’ll run out of numbers and all be back there."
thread 21 is only like 2 hours ago :)
Hahaha what a fucking moron

Yes
Yep
This article says he's a registered republican https://www.wnep.com/article/news/local/luzerne-county/man-arrested-for-voter-fraud-in-luzerne-county/523-7fc4fd2f-9105-47e7-a510-2b5ff176ab2c
Probably Hilldog. They other two are too classy honestly but Hillary will do it.
Obama. That’ll probably piss him off most.
Pelosi
I think it would sting most from either Obama or Hillary
"Obama tweets a link with covid death toll saying ""it's TRUMP'S fault""

Biden then gets to tweet ""YOU'RE FIRED"" at Trump. 

Followed by Hillary tweeting ""LOCK HIM UP!!"""
Gotta be Biden to end his speech. Has to be
Hillary for the lulz
Pelosi just to make the conservatives angrier
D - Every single person who voted for Biden - all simultaneously tweeting the same message.
Hillary
"If Hillary did it, Fox News would literally blow a fuse and possibly a blood vessel."
Yes
D) all of the above
Hillary
Obama
Obama would bother him the most
Barack for sure
All the above
Bama. cause that would infuriate the fuck out of him.
My man Obama
D all of the above
Yes
"Hillary tbh

Obama will get his laugh through the vote count if Trump doesn't get past his 2008 number"
Hopefully John McCain queued it up before be passed away. That'd be poetic justice.
America.
"&#x200B;

rosie o'donnell"
D. Voters. We're his boss after all.
Hillary needs to rub his nose in his own pile of shit. Then say “YOU WERE BAD! AMERICA HATES YOU”
Obama for sure
Biden of course
Literally everyone who owns a Twitter account should send one.
D- All of the above
Tough call. I think Biden deserves it tbh
Can he stunner Trump on inauguration day?
hell yeah!
I keep calling him a Mango Mussolini.
"you gotta be tactical with your shade.   


Being profane throttles your reach"
"I told him to taste test some cyanide today and got hit immediately with a ban.

It's my second account to get a permaban for advising that sort of lifestyle"
It'd be great if everyone just gave up on Twitter.  And the other one.  The Facepals.
Hell never concede
Il drink my cum
"Screenshot and saved, you best be ready."
Saved.
"Can we bet on that, the concession not your poop eating, they probably wouldn't even release odds for Trump to concede tonight"
"He's going to double down on crazy, he won't ever concede."
Plastic bag or paper
If I win a billion dollars I’ll donate it you. Now we’ve both said things that aren’t going to happen
Paper or plastic?
You'll be safe
"If Trump concedes at all, I'll eat it for you."
"The power of the ring is treacherous, it will hold you to your word..."
damn I picked a bad username
"For Electoral Vote purposes, I will be declaring war on the United States of America."
my god really
"Twitter can kick him, right? he's not a public official."
This family needs to be removed from American society. They are a cancer.
"oh dear, ihope twitter deletes that. it is deeply irresponsible."
"I wouldn’t worry too much, I hear bone spurs runs in the family"
Holy shit
The desperation is getting more elevated by the minute. DJT Jr is openly encouraging a coupe on his Twitter page.
Banana Republic is always having those sale tho...
This isn’t some figurative “war on fraud” he is suggesting; this is a dog whistle to all the dipshit idiots that are salivating for an actual civil war.
"So wild, especially considering how the right wing is basically saying Biden is going to start a civil war while Jr. is out here actually suggesting it himself"
I want my BidenBox Series X
Not without the senat unfortunately
we truly are the flordia of the world
"More people voted for Trump in 2020 than in 2016.  I don't think we're in any danger of looking more sane now.  Our standing is semi-permanently lowered, and it may take decades to recover that, if we ever do."
Yeah I see Joe mostly reversing Trump's damage and pushing for what America was heading to in 2016 . Whoever is elected in 2024 would be the progressive
"Investigating Trump would be a good start. That ""Individual One"" must turn into an actual name."
Half of U.S voters still voted for Trump... And they might re-elect him in 2024.
Nah we can't become complacent. Otherwise another trump will come along.
I just made it in my mind. It was great! Good idea.
"Come on NV, PA, or GA? Don’t you guys wanna be Gandalf in this scenario?"
What would you have for the scene where the Uruk Hai charges in with the bomb?
"Georgia could save the presidency, and the two runoff senate races could save the senate"
Let me show you the door...
Good riddance
Complaining about “Key Race Alert” was so thread 33.
Rats
I called this in like thread 12. Its telling all the GOP leaders have shunned Trumps wild cheating claims. Turtle Mitch has no use for Orangeman anymore.

Where's that? Georgia?
Are you talking about Georgia?
Where you Gettin this from? Honest question
Sorry this is PA or GA??

I wish I could put $750 down on a bet for a Biden win.  But it might be too late for it to even be a meaningful bet.
Can’t lose what is always lost...

"The runoffs are a lock.

The Republican vote total is only going down, not up."
Nevada went up 1% and are probably all tuckered out for the next few days
Just FYI this has been said basically since the dawn of time
"There's going to be a demographic shift as the older generation dies off, and the political leanings should follow with that. You'll always have people - particularly in red states - who adhere to family political views, but by and large the younger generation is much less concerned with social conservatism, more focused on economic equity, etc. I suspect as older Republicans die out conservatism will stop being so socially conservative, and as older Democrats die off, liberalism will become more progressive."
"I'm somewhat confident that sane economic policy will pull some barely-right-leaning people to ""left"" (US left). Like those surveys say, a lot of people think they are better off than 4 years ago, but the country isn't. If they can now answer yes to both, they'll probably consider changing parties."
"Considering the number of MAGAs that are going to die from Covid by not taking precautions, I'm guessing time is not on their side."
"Red and blue change but the divide stays the same. I think the republicans change is more unknown than democrats. I feel republicans will try to embrace “liberal socially/conservative fiscally” as the older religious population dies out, but who knows."
"Depends on how Biden does as a president, if the economy goes well it’ll probably swing blue"
"It'd just be awful if enough of them died off to break the gridlock.  Then we might get universal healthcare, meaningful climate change reform, etc.  Just awful."

Yo

I can't mom RN if that counts

Little Pimp*
"There's a guy I used to work with, we'd go out and get drunk and make fun of other people at work.  It was a great time.  But I wouldn't want him as a boss or in any sort of position of responsibility."
I'll be doing Postcards to Voters for them soon I'm sure.
"Believe me, both sides are absolutely working that.

I work in market research and we get bid requests for focus groups before runoffs even happen if they’re possible.  I’ve had projects get signed the minute the runoff happens and start immediately.

That’s happening now in GA for sure with all of the consultants and ad agencies doing their thing.  On both sides."
Is he supposed to be speaking?
I’ve never been so excited to hear him speak lol
Would’ve been better if it was 46but I’ll settle for anything.
it will be a win for America.
how high did the 2016 thread go to?
They're changing his batteries out
Mother grounded him.

Why so sure? Just curious
Actually 39k left to count. But math is still favored unless there is some serious misestimation of outstanding ballots.
il join you!
Oh good idea
most people would probably go for a cup of joe at this point
Cocoas a hell of a drink
"40,000 left"
There's enough in theory. It'll be super close.
Yes
He needs 60% of outstanding and has been getting 70%
Savannah is a pretty liberal city so fingers crossed
"Barely, but yes"
45k left so yes
That's why it hasn't been called. He needs about 2/3rds of the remaining votes.
~40k
"Yep. He needs 60% of what's left. He's getting 69% so far. It's more comfortable than Trumps chance to win AZ which is Trump needs 57% and is getting 58% so far. Trump has a 1% variation to lose Arizona.

Biden has a 9 point cushion"
"Remaining: 43,404

Differential: 9,535

Biden needs: 60.98%

Biden is averaging: 69.8%

Remaining can go up as more mail-ins arrive over the week."
"Yes. [https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html). It appears Biden can win by 30k votes, if trends continue"
Yup he needs 62% but it was 66% before but he’s been outperforming the batches that has been coming out
There's around 40k votes left in GA to tally.
Theres 43k left. Biden would have to win 61% of them though.
"Possibly, if there’s some uncounted mail ballots he can easily beat him out."
"Yeah, he's been tracking just slightly above"
There are.
"Yees, he need to get about 64% of the remaining ones. Doable, but it's going to be very close either way."
"There's roughly 50,000 ballots left to count in Georgia. I think it's safe to say that Biden will win Georgia."
Georgia always gives up huge leads at the end of the game. Biden's got it
Must’ve gotten the sloth from Zootopia
The fucking shit show if all four leaned Blue would be a nightmare. Trump would throw lawyers keeping this shit tied up for weeks. But we can only hope :)
Nevada is over
What’s the percent counted in AZ
"Not hard at all to imagine, as they're already started."
I'd be happy knowing Q from star trek was back.
Who's going to get the pedos then?
Biden is being mind controlled by Obama to fight pedophiles so they can steal the credit from Trump
I'd prefer not to have nightmares tonight
44kish
" 43,404 votes remaining, good chances"
Perdue has slipped just below 50% so the runoff is likely.
43k
40.000 left to vote. If Biden gets 62% of them he wins
Roughly 30-35k I’m assuming based on what was last reported by the secretory of state for GA
40k
"40k left from HEAVILY democrat areas. Places where Biden is currently winning. 17,157 votes left in Chatham county - Biden is winning that 58/41. 7,300 in Fulton County - Biden is winning that 73/26. 6026 in Clayton County - Biden is winning 85/14. Plus these votes are skewing extremely for Biden. NYT has Biden at 64% chance to win Georgia and it's looking more and more likely."
About 39k left. Biden needs 62% to pass Trump.
Reading between the lines Biden wins
Nope

"That would a be a tipping point for civil unrest, I doubt they do so"
Trump hoping any ballot not voted for Trump is invalid and should not be counted.
If they do it will be labor strikes and riots across the nation. I doubt the GOP are going to let that happen just to save trump when they have a solid gameplan to hamstring biden and blame the resulting quagmire on him to boost their 2024 candidate
But only in states who voted for Biden
AZ sos lady said we would get some results At 7. She estimated 100k votes.
"PA by midnight, AZ gonna be a while still I think. They dragging ass."
Hasn't AZ been called?
AZ should be reporting more at 9pm ET
"PA still aiming for 4 hours from now, ish?  I think?"
Both tomorrow i think

It's ming boggling the level of stupidity we're seeing."
35k votes in a county are not going to be counted today at all. Those will go 70% for Biden. 15k margin would be covered there itself.
78K!
He declared victory 2 nights ago.

In fairness that's just a symptom of the Hollywood propaganda mill where US can do no wrong
"Nixon was very very well liked as a President in his time. It is in retrospect that we know about his crimes and horrors and they're amplified by nature of him being the only President to resign.

I don't think Trump will ever be viewed the way W has been treated recently. W's reign was full of horrors... but it wasn't the bottom. Trump is the intellectual, moral bottom. The Republicans would have to nominate and get a convicted pedophile elected to go lower than this.

They can go more dangerous certainly... but one's reputation as a human being surely can't sink lower than Trump's. I just don't see it."
I feel like it will focus a lot on the ridiculousness of everything that has happened over these past 4 years. Like.... there is just so much stuff that I would’ve thought would be too out there but nope

"Well, if they're a net siphon from Trump (people who would have voted for him otherwise), they're actually helping save us in a way, though less so if they'd have voted for Biden.  

Each would-be Trump voter who votes for Jorgenson is like 1/2 of a voter for Biden in terms of the resulting margins in a binary Biden vs. Trump contest."
"I mean, if you're a libertarian why would you not vote for the libertarian party?

Fuck the green party, really."
No I have things to do. Fuck Don Jr.
The Trumps would rather see Americans die than have American voices be heard.
What tweet are you talking about?
Um it's still a pandemic everyone should be staying the fuck inside anyway lol
Right. I thought it was Antifa and the Radical Left's turn to start a war!
Not sure how they are not locked up for saying such things... Or at the very very VERY least having their accounts deleted/banned for that..
Trump will need fresh Depends after that.
Honestly I'm more worried about them migrating to the citys.  I live in a deep read county in PA and I'm not all that worried there will be much damage here.
The power of Gritty
Flip flip flipadelphia!
Flip flip flipadelphia
"Hate Philly, love to see it. Go boys, save us keystoners."
I'm imagining a personified Philadelphia bodily lifting a Pennsylvania-shaped chunk of the earth and inverting it
I like your words.
"5pm tomorrow for PA ? Please no, not one more day of this."
Nah.
2am Friday or Saturday?
Philadelphia haven't reported much today. Watch them dump a large cache in primetime for the haymaker.
Biden's lead in Nevada is so narrow. Are the remaining counties really Democrat dominant?
Same as AP NPR and Politico
We love to see it.
"I think PA gets called and NV called at the same time. That way, Fox has no issue calling the race at that point."
I’m sure they’re hoping PA or GA is called first so they can call Nevada and not have to worry about the possible AZ situation.
"The behind 600k thing is illusory, though.  It’s an artifact of counting and says nothing about the actual votes cast."
"Win or lose, GA is now officially a purple state."
"Don’t do that.

Don’t give me hope."
I think they might. I dont think any of them wants to be the first to announce out of fear what the MAGA idiots might do.
"Nevada isn't even counting, but I haven't really considered the possibility of GA and PA announcing simultaneously"
"Georgia is iffy to me, it'll be close either way. But a Nevada call is definitely waiting on Pennsylvania. AP and Fox already called Arizona and Nevada would put Biden at 270 but I think that might be jumping the gun a bit. CNN wouldn't wanna call Nevada yet because they wanna wait on Arizona and there'd be even more confusion as to whether Biden won or not when you look at Fox/AP vs CNN/ABC. I think once PA is called, Nevada would immediately follow."
NV? no
"Ultra Combo?

Brutality?"
Oh fuck. Someone call Q anonymous.
*stares in British cordite*
The frothy mixture would still be more relevant
That's always my first thought whenever I see him.
"wait is that what it is? I've always defined it as cum and fecal matter.

Oh well, porque no los dos?"
Happy birthday your mom!
"I love you, Booger butt!"

Happy birthday mom. I've always loved you
Happy Birthday Ma! I hope she is getting the political results she wants for her birthday.

My 290 Biden - 248 Trump is looking good still
Yes but Trump is over performing in AZ. We have to be patient
Nate Silver effectively called it
Silver called it as much as did Ralston
Yes
"Nevada is useless without Arizona, so what are the odds on Arizona?"
Yes
"> (97% chance). Is it safe to assume

You're not an xcom player then?"
"Yep, Clark County is where 90% of the remaining votes are from.

Trump is averaging 44% currently and he needs to be closer to 54% to overcome the deficit. 

He's toast. Biden takes Nevada.

https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html"
I got boxes full of Pepe!
Nope. NBC just did a whole segment on it. Everyone votes by mail there so you can't assume they favor Biden. Bidens lead is dwindling
First time I’ve ever watched CNN and I’ve barely turned it off for 48 hours.
"I used to watch it every morning before work, but their missing flight coverage a while back made me find something else to do."
"What elite guards lmao, who's gonna put their lives on the line for that orange turd?"
"The guards will be working for the new guy on e he is inaugurated, so that would be sort of comical. Like the betrayal scene in a movie."
"Wow, that's a lot less than 431,735 that NYT is estimating."
"Day 182: Society has collapsed, there is little food and no clean water left. I ate the cat this morning, but there was barely any sustainance left on his meager body. There is word of a safe zone to the East, but I have dismissed that as rumors. As I sit in the crumbling remains of my home, the radio crackles; ""326,000 votes left, they say we may know for certain by Saturday"""
"yep. Alaska obviously going trump, nc about 90% chance going trump, rest blue"
Wasn't that 2016's final count?
Sounds plausible!
All uncalled except NC break Biden's way?
I'd say most people are in that boat too
Biden is on the verge of taking Nevada and Georgia. He may not need Pennsylvania.
This bullshit is why we gotta keep our eyes on az nv & Georgia. Just in case
Lava shits for days man
I feel personally attacked as I bathroomscroll
not at this moment but my asshole was completely raw two nights ago
"Are you, me?"
Just headaches...
And my ass.
Yelling at Philadelphia is how you get batteries thrown at you.
"The more you yell at Philly, the stronger they get at you!"
Probably some of the most stubborn people in the country hahaha. They probably counted faster.
So did Trump.
"Boy do I relate. This seems like a good time for my eighth cup of stress coffee, though.

 also can anyone here tell me what *bad* heart palpitations feel like?"
Donald? Is that you?
"9,525"
The Murdochs send their regards.
I sure hope so. It will be beautiful
What a laughable man. Why is he so intent on being in politics?
What did he say?
I missed it. Paraphrase?
What was it?
Totally lol
Unlikely. A lot of people voted R Senate but Biden across the country. Probably especially true in GA.
Looks that way
Why can't I fast-forward...
Pittsburgh isn't counting until tomorrow
"Chattum County where there are 17k votes outstanding in GA have already said they won't report until tomorrow, so Georgia almost certainly won't be announced today."
"By my math, Georgia only averaged ~3k votes/hour over the past eight hours. :("
Reminds me of when the Patriots were coming back on the Falcons in that Super Bowl. Except this time ATL is getting it done!
"Seventh overtime, more like it"
Not to mention the sexiest of runoff elections
Just continually chug water in anticipation.
That's a great piece of insight. Thanks!
It’s like the worst Christmas Eve anticipation ever
"That’s one of the things I’m most looking forward to. Unredacted Mueller report will be fun too. And sticking it to Flynn, if he doesn’t get pardoned."
With a red senate?
Mitch is gonna moan and stomp his feet
"Lol, Nevada gave an ""update"" earlier today, they counted like 1000 votes or something, then said ""Be back tomorrow. Oh by the way, we may not be done until Saturday or Sunday"""
"Arizona reporting a chunk at 9pm eastern. Should have a good idea by then. 

Nevada is taking their time with the vote counting. They are saying there is a process for verifying mail in votes to ensure accuracy. Officials said to expect about 50k to be reported tomorrow at 10am mountain."
Nevada Sec of State said it would be completed 11/13.
Biden is about to flip Georgia blue. LET'S FUCKING GO!!!
"Given presidential race so close, its def possible"
Not really. Run offs aren't very good for Democratic candidates in GA. Ossoff is also an underwhelming candidate. He *might* get a bump though since Warnock is also going to his run off. Warnock is a much more exciting candidate that I can see Metro-Atlanta rallying behind.
No
"I'd imagine so. Sir Tiny Hands brought out the vote for this one, I doubt his supporters will have as much enthusiasm in January, especially with the way he's claiming everything is rigged/fraudulent. We could easily see apathy sink in with his base."
"Probably not tbh because it’s a 2 person race. But it’s better than Dickbag Perdue winning right off. Make him spend some more money, fuck him."
"In terms of prior polling, Ossoff was usually facing an uphill battle. That being said, with Georgia going so close already and Joe Biden potentially gaining a pseudo-bully pulpit as the President-elect, there mayyy be more of a chance in the run-off? I wouldn't favor Ossoff, but it's gonna be tight, and he might have some chance."
"With that race receiving all of the national attention, yes."
Maybe... part of it will depend on how much an insane and broken Donald affects his electorate.
They get a few months to talk about how the senate is at stake.
"Maybe the Maga cult might lose momentum and inspiration and  also more time to campaign , could happen"
People will go out to support Warnock and hopefully Osoff can benefit from it
"If Biden voters show up, yeah. I doubt the big Republican turnout surge that happened with Trump on the ballot will show up as enthusiastically for Perdue and Loeffler."
"What actually triggers a runoff? (Non yank here)

And is a runoff just rerun of the voting?"
I think there is a real chance but dems should not squander the momentum that might come from a Biden win
"I think yes for a few reasons. It's vying for control of the senate. High stakes drives high turnout. These runoffs will be the epicenter of national politics for the next 2 months. Hundreds of millions of dollars will be spent on them. They won't be ordinary run offs. 

Also, check out these tweets. [tweet 1](https://twitter.com/EricTrump/status/1324473286366027776?s=20) and [tweet 2](https://twitter.com/RudyGiuliani/status/1324469108663111681?s=20)

It's starting to look like if Trump goes down then he's taking the entire party with him. It's not unlikely he tells his supporters not to vote to ""teach the GOP a lesson"" or something similar"
"I was just watching that. he is and has always been full of shit.


they are loosing thier minds there."
That sign language interpreter though.  He makes the show
Was that Windows notification sound in the livestream just now?
Electronic vs opening literally millions of envelopes and manually adding a vote.
I assume they have to be verified for validity which adds time to the process.
doesnt PA allow votes to be received up until three days after? as long as they are post marked by election day
"Opening envelopes, unfolding ballots, comparing signatures, etc."
They have to take them out of envelopes
"My guess is they have to be opened like a letter, validated, then counted, whereas the validation for in person is done before you vote. So in person votes may only have one or at most two steps"
"Have you ever tried to open 1,000,000 envelopes. Verified signatures and checked details.    

Be thankful that the process is working.  It's supposed to take time and be done correctly."
"Theyre trying to give trump man a chance to stop the count, or for protestors to riot and tain the ballots etc

This shit is on purpose lol"
Digitally tracked voting machines versus manually counted mail ballots where envelopes have to be individually opened and checked over for errors
"They have to have to be opened, have their voter ID checked, have their signature compared to their voter signature, flattened and then scanned. There's 70 million of these...it's a shit load. Covid cut down on the amount of people available."
They go through a more involved verification process than voting in person.
They have to be verified.
They have to be removed from envelopes and checked for legitimacy.
Because they have to be individually examined and authenticated.
"Some states have passed laws where in person ballots are counted before mail in. In other cases its the opposite such as in Ohio where Biden led early but was probably never overly competitive. No idea why it's taking as long as it is however in the remaining states, other than perhaps the workers on the ground being exhausted, having so many votes to count in general, etc."
"Election day votes are done by machines, often are already done in electronic voting booths, and are handled much more uniformly by less people. 

Mail in votes often can't be done by machines due to being handled oddly (weird creases and stuff like that) and also have to be verified (making sure signatures match). 

Most states counted mail ins as they arrive, these numptys have laws that say they can't start until election day."
"A few reasons, some states sabotaged themselves from being able to do it quickly. Like making rules that they’re not allowed to count them until election day. A lot of them don’t come in until election day. And they need to be counted by hand.
States that have fully adopted mail in voting Lake Washington and Oregon are actually pretty fast at it."
"They aren't allowed to even open the ballots until election day, and they are subject to more scrutiny than in-person voting because they have to be referenced against the list of people who voted in person to prevent people from voting twice. They also need to check witness signatures."
"I'm gonna go to Atlanta, visit their awesome aquarium and then go to Magic City to get some wings...and possibly a lap dance."
with masks on though because it's still 2020!
They will literally flip
"Just try to repeat what a speaker is saying continuously for a minute, bet you have a hard time."
"Yeah, it's super impressive."
"I saw a sign language interpreter at a Trevor Noah comedy show held at a college once years ago (pre-Daily Show but right around that time). I can't imagine how they were able to do that job in that kind of situation. He included her in his set as well, seeing what he could make her say. There's no real point to this aside from saying I also respect those interpreters."
"Yes, live translators (for both spoken and signed languages) have to work in <1hr shifts because its so exhausting."
They did censor is tweet so that’s good.
Yeah sounds like they know.
It sounds like she's thinking Friday.
\*laughs in PST\*
"yeah fr, its almost 12 am and i have school at 9:50"
Europa*
Nevada will dump 7 more votes in 3 hours
"That was me in Australia last night, when i went to bed with Georgia at 30k votes and Penn at 150k. If you sleep, you'll probably wake to a still no call, and even more adrenaline pumping tension as those races inch closer"
New Zealand here. We’ll take the next shift.
Go to bed man. We’ve possibly got another 12-24 hours
"9k vote margin, 40k to go. I think we get it"
I think it’s around 40000.
"Hard to tell exactly how many are left, that has been the least reliable on the feed, but:  [https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html)"
Under 10k. Clayton and Chatham county votes should flip it
"its very, very, very, very close (~9500 gap, 43k left)"
"less than 40K, if I recall correctly?"
We don’t know because there’s a bunch that DeJoy is still hoarding.
"Estimated to be around 40,000 from what I've seen."
"Trump family will commit suicide. Trump has heavily paid faux news to report in favor of them. 

They already shot trump in the foot by declaring AZ for biden. 

He will literally cry. Just dont!"
"Are you kidding? He's got four years of being an outrage merchant to look forward to. He's probably happy, the cynical bastard"
"Why would he leave now? He'll get at least another good three months out of this ""conspiracy"" mess"
Now he gets to paint Biden as a boogeyman for thr next 4 years. Fox is gonna Fox
Didn’t seem to hurt him when he did it 2 years ago. Probably won’t hurt him when he does it again in 2 years.
He wouldn’t be elected governor after losing 2 senate races in a row lol
Presses 'X' to doubt.
He’s so good. He deserves the biggest raise after this.
Which is?
So how many votes is Biden expected to win by?
About what?
"Oh psh, well if it matches your math ..."
Did wannabe dictator Donnie ask him to have the military get involved?
Gonna have to issue a flash flood watch in the vicinity lol
"Here is what I don't understand. If this were true, then why did the DEEP STATE let him win the first time around? It's so devoid of logic."
Dude must be coming down hard from all the blow.
Elaborate OMG
"I pulled it up in a private tab because, yeah"
"highly educated in which fields though?

plenty of useless degrees and college debt out there"
"Very, very strange. I always thought that the people voting Trump would be the greatest minds of this country and not the bottom feeders that are spamming nonsense in capslock on Twitter while lubricating their anus to take Papa Donny's autocratic wiener."
"which is really great news for biden, there is about 450k outstanding, so 150k not reported yet which probably still goes to him heavily"
Philly is going to bring it home baby!
Provided they are not all from Port Richmond then it’ll be predominantly Dem.
Lmaoo
"Seriously, why is this dude pushing the voter fraud narrative."
What are they saying?  Massive PA fraud?
"How are they handling all this?  I haven't tuned in since they went ""Full-Trump"" a few years ago."
Same lol.
"* denial.

* anger.

* bargaining.

* depression.

* acceptance.

On Fox, they are vacillating between denial through bargaining and back over and over, right now.  Apparently, if Trump loses, they won.  Or something."
What’s going on there? I can’t watch atm but people keep talking about it on here
"i havent watched anything from fox news in like 15 years, it was always just people screeching at each other. that entire era of oreilly yelling at someone and then cutting them off the second they respond was nothing but pure garbage."
But he hasn't even had first victory yet.
Would be funny considering current results don’t give him 270 anyways
"We've had first victory, yes"
"If it isn’t concession, I don’t care"
Where
I'm honestly really worried about the shit he's going to say.
More like Berlusconi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilE4lr9Qb3A
"I wish, but the results are coming in so agonizingly slow"
I fucking wish! I want a matching trump face to that guiliani one.
Fuck yeah!!!!
Where are you getting this!
I thought he found out that Hunter Biden’s laptop had a program on it that directly sends the ballots needed in key states to steal the election.
"If he doesnt, his idiot sons will."
do you have a link to an announcement of him speaking?
Probably
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
"30k dump. He won 21k of them for a gain of 12. 70%, well above what he needs for the rest of them."
~66% Biden
"“They want to steal our election, defend your freedom and fight back again the deep state.”"
Hope he doesn't call for a civil war or something...
"lol I was not guessing that would be his name.

Edit: Just realized you said it was stolen from him."
It wouldn't be the weirdest thing to happen this week
Ugh that episode was terrifying.
"He is, brace yourself."
I know he's been busy with identifying the boog boy arrested in Portland last night but I'm surprised Evans hasn't said anything about those rallying e-mails sent out by Trump yesterday. Those combined with Barr's thoughts on federal officers entering polling places and the reports on Mark Esper's prepared early resignation letter are worrying.
wouldn't that be the best thing ever
That thought cured my husbands Erectile Disfunction.
Both PA and GA could flip blue during this rant.
"I could respect that. But honestly, he doesnt have the upper body strength to hang onto the rope"
What is the rope for? I hope you arent suggesting he would hold onto it as a chopper lifted him away.
Is science on their side at all?
Facts over feelings party praying for divine intervention because the facts don't help them LOL
"I mean, i hope God (Goddess, or whatever name you give to the deity) is on the side of humanity"
But Trump is going to declare victory again at 6:30. JFC
"It really is. I think we're just waiting for PA at this point. Once the leader flips to Biden, they'll call the state and the election. Nevada can fuck off and take another month then, who cares."
"In Georgia 

Well not by much"
If it was popular vote Dems would just win everytime because population wise there are millions more democrats. I mean not saying thats right but that's why it will never change
"Better yet. 100 people are in a room. Most cluster in groups here and there. One guy stays in a corner where no one else goes.

Someone asks them all to vote on something that will affect them all. 

When it's time to count the votes corner guys tells everyone his vote matters more than anyone else because he's the only one in the corner and no one understands corner people problems so he should get more of a say."
"It should be popular vote. But the reason is not some error or oversight. The people are not intended to elect the President. The states are. They are a second sovereign in our county. Each state gets a certain number of electoral votes and each state gets to decide how to award them.

The idea was to bring the states to the table as equals and make sure Mississippi had a fair vote compared to new York. NOT that the people of either state have one."
Not a chance lol
Never. Would be funny though
lol not until January 20
"Hah, no way."
No way in hell
Incredibly unlikely
I'm sure he will graciously and eloquently concede. That's what he's known for after all.
"I hope so, but I don't think his ego could take that hit."
"LmAo yeah ok, guy isn’t going to admit defeat until January."
Why so confident?
"It's a riot, I hope they all eat each other"
This is going to be common place going forward and I'm all for it
Lindsey is ready to fold himself like the previous 999 times.
It will be extremely close
Please be right. I can't help but worry about AZ.
I can’t believe anything until it’s done now.
"Chatham is not as blue as you think. It favors Biden, but not by much."
Oh god. How lame.
"""Rick, we are going to pay you well for sitting and talking shit. You up for it?"" - CNN"
He's already sent emails out and videos doing so
2 minute delay on broadcasting it.
"I'm not sure he actually has to call for violence. His constant bs about fraud and how rigged it is spews violence already. No need to say the actual word ""violence"" anymore"
It's actually both!
Yes.
He doesn't know how to argue on that and always laughs when he's actually out of words and doesn't believe it either. Idk why this guy is even there
I mean he was willingly sleeping around with a Russian spy so....
Both. He’s a very religious right wing nut job former senator. Plus he gets paid big money to be the conservative voice on CNN.
Fuck the GOP. They've enabled this traitor for more than 4 years. We'll remember.
"Oh, you're thinking of the before-times.

Yeah, no, that's gone.  Like Alderaan-gone.  All bets are off."
"Did you not see the results? Trump got more votes after all the racist, misogynistic, and violence-inciting things he said. This will not look bad for them, and I won’t be surprised if Trump is the nominee again. Or worse, a smart Trump."
"He's gonna send the army into Atlanta, Pheonix and Philly."
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
Hyped to commit tax fraud!
Dick shrinkage is breathtaking.
"Holy shit that's exactly what I'm doing, down to the Publix part."
2020 ...
"Well, of that happens while you're there, your groceries are free"
"That would be fucking glorious. I don’t watch him give press conferences to preserve my sanity, but I’d watch that."
">WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE, TRUMP SAYS HE'S BEING CHEATED

Love it."
How vivid is your imagination?
Very.
Yes.
1/3 of America is stupid enough.
I think it was under 30 seconds before they corrected his false claims.
He doesn’t seem to grasp that people may specifically have voted against him and in favor of other GOP candidates to check Biden’s power. That is so easy to understand
He won't. McConnell has all but signaled they're going to abandon him.
I missed the start. Anything important. Been watching for like 90s.
I'm honestly kind of proud of them.
65k lead for Doncon?
I love this fucking reference coming from a Europe history course
Let's just hope he doesn't come back from exile on Elba
This inlynworked in 2000 because they were able to halt a recount with trump in the lead. If they freeze counts now.. biden wins. Not that they have any grounds or authority to halt the initial count... at all.
Me too!
Unlikely. About 25K+ ballots remain to be counted and Biden is hitting rates of 67% when he only needs 57%.
more than half a million ballots are thrown out every election
"Yep - that was gold (""...flailing in the hot sun"" to give it its full credit)"
NV has like 1 part-time blind dude counting all the votes
"GA might happen too, it’s super close but man, that would be a nice bonus"
They're fucking betting on each ballot only explanation tbf
"Sudden Departure. 

Did anyone get that Leftovers reference?"
Don't forget about GA
they do not want to be the one
I think they are waiting on more security.
"The remaining ballots in AZ should favor Trump, so it'll tighten up there at least."
"I mean with the latest Maricopa mail-ins leaning Trump and Yuma also leaning Trump, I'm not sure if AZ is totally in the bag."
Even Rick Santorum refused to agree with any of what Trump is saying.
So did NBC on youtube. Didn't even return to him until they ended the segment.
"It sure does.

GA is carrying a hell of a burden, and theyre doing a hell of a job so far."
"Yep, everyone is quickly moving to GA briefly to establish residency."
NBC announced about an hour ago that there’d be a run off.
What's a run off?
That's exactly what it means!!!
A peach cheese cake. Please flip.
"You could make a savory sauce out of the peaches such as ""mustard peach sauce"" or ""peppery peach sauce"". It's kinda like dijon mustard."
 South Carolina peaches are definitely better though. lol
Order sauces online from a place in Savannah called Zunzi's. It's heaven on chicken and salmon.
It's where my wife and I had our first kiss.
Peach Cobbler baby!
Magic city baby!
Trump is going down faster than a Miss Teen USA contestant in a Trump Tower elevator
You just explained my feelings perfectly
"He started a war with the left.

Then he lost it."
I like that he didn't start a war. Pretty much the only thing I like about him. I know it's a low bar.
"He did start a war. A war against freedom, sanity, equality, education."
"He tried with Iran, but they wouldn't take the bait."
"Lol, a war where he's outnumbered by almost four million. K."
Bravo
Beautiful comment
To be a big Mac wrapper in the oval office....
"2017 deep cut

Edit: that was, apparently, 3 years ago not 3 months."
This is almost vintage
So Georgia is now more likely than Arizona??? Wtf
thanks for this post!
"This is some good easy to digest stuff, thanks"
"If Biden wins Ga, AZ, NV, and PA, and 7M more votes, that is pretty damn close to a landslide in my book."
"4 million vote lead that's going to get bigger followed by a losing AZ, NV, MI, WI, PA and GA? Not quite a landslide but that's commanding (if all the trends hold)"
Hey at least Parasect is cute
It's also what Paras evolves into. Sorry not sorry
You know they can’t
I’ve done enough looking to last a lifetime tbh
Exactly. The turn from red to blue is even more damaging to Trump's psyche. He'll go crazy but the problem is that he will still be president for the next three months if things go right for Biden. That makes him the biggest threat to the world. God help us and godspeed.
"> The celebration of the first woman elected to the executive is coming.

Is US history that bad? There's going to be some freak out if something happens to 77 year old Biden and we see a black woman president."
Go Joe!
">because Biden was robbed of a victory speech on election night and we all count have celebrated worldwide and it would have been great.

Ah, true.

HOWEVER. It's Friday in Australia so many of us will have ample chance to celebrate with/for you if it's called within the next 36-48 hours."
Can he point to where it says that in the Constitution? 🤔
Not watching CNN but I'm guessing it's Rick Santorum?
"To be fair most of the absentee ballots look to be Democrat, so of course it's wrong to count them - Republican logic"
They dont even see the irony in that.
Heh.  The folks who wrote the Constitution had to send word of local election counts by horseback or by sailing ship.  They wouldn't have known the outcome of a general election for weeks
His lawyers confiscated his phone
"Maybe, ""The president is alive and well,"" was a lie?"
Must be nappy time after a fish delight
"His campaign already stated that he is alive and well.

Translation: Mini-strokes"
Hopefully they darted him and he is napping.
no wifi in his escape tunnel
we havent seen Trump since 2 AM on election night
He’s packing up the Penske.
Need proof of life after that
"He’s probably chained up in the basement of the White House, demanding they build him a skull throne"
He's pulling an Epstein

Impossible.
He's on a plane heading to Moscow.
That's a normal Thanksgiving with the in-laws for me
They still have ~8k military votes they need to count by tomorrow that are not part of the current number because some haven't arrived yet. Looks like we're gonna have to hold our breath till then.
"total war lmao

twitter needs to ban the whole family"
As if they're not the ones turning us into a banana republic.
Yea. Because the last voter fraud worked out so well for them.  Lol
We saw this coming.
...isn’t trump considered a “no longer in state voter”?
Why do you care what that dipshit says? Ignore him and he'll go away.
"That's absolutely sick, these morons are on a power high and are trying to start a friggen war to take it back by any means."
Total war :)

"Aka, they don't want to be the ones to call the election."
"How would that cause controversy and what would be different when they release them,?"
Well that's fucking stupid.
What controversy would they cause?
Does that mean Biden?
20K ballots are on hold in Allegheny county due to a lawsuit too.
if thats true it might be a good sign... Only one side would call a sudden influx of votes changing the race fraud... And its the Trumpy Republicans...
God why did I have to see gym jordans face
"Hes definitely correct, letting people vote for someone who isn't a Republican is basically the *definition* of tyranny."

These guys just... really make my head hurt.
Its all part of the the liberal hoax called 'reality'.
Wow these people are stupid. I really wish Gym got voted out. Can’t stand that fucker and his whiny voice
He represents the district adjacent to mine. Not that my rep is any better. Trash all around.
Straight to jail.
THE RADICAL DEMS ARE USING THE 2020 ELECTION AS A PLOY TO UNDO THE RESULTS OF THE 2016 ELECTION
"He was begging for a war with Iran some months ago, but I guess people forgot about that."
Didn't start a foreign war.
It's hard watching bootlickers feed.
Somehow they claim dems will start wars.  They tried saying Hillary would start a war.  Biden is about to start wars.  Yet major US wars were started/extended by which party????
Also it's not like he didn't try. Did we all just forget his blatant assassination of an Iranian general? That could have easily spiraled out of control.
"Just ran out yesterday :(

Then he won't be a winner. It's hell for him.
About damn time it went blue.
Ossoff runnoff
good.  the GOP will kick them to their curb.
How so? Do tell
Hopefully PA is called tonight I cant take another day of this.
Where is Chatham county?  Sounds like GA.
"Assuming Biden gets 80% there, it would put him ahead roughly 1k or so."
It will. By my estimate Biden can expect 12K from Chatham and Clayton *alone.*

Slow motherfuckers
Maricopa County was a 49/45 split in Trumps favour in 2016.
Pretty much. By tomorrow night we might have a clearer picture on who actually won AZ.
"Trump will probably close the gap a bit more, but I don’t see him overtaking Biden. Maricopa leans blue by about 4 points."
"Same really. I'm not voting for biden. I'm voting against trump. 


Biden has my vote still tho."
it was the “would you shut up man” for me
Same
Me either but it is refreshing to see someone act like a leader. Donald Trump is a bafflingly bad leader.
the DNC is what really solidified my support
Same. Dude's a pro...
"If he was one of our politicians I would vote for him, he's not as liberal as I would like but he's a good man"
"If trump wins, by that time, USA will have become an autocrat regime"
Do they just have one dude counting?
Good or bad news for Biden?
Mrs McCain asked that they take their sweet sweet time to stress the orange one mucho...
I guess you better wake him up then.
He is a little whiny rich boy that has gotten away with his privilege his whole life...he knows it’s over. He is going out kicking and screaming by the people of this country.
Audio on YouTube is a bust for whatever reason. Or is it my machine?
CNN also carrying
hopefully it plays out like the bunker under berlin.
We do because AZ is looking shaky
I'm really hoping Biden can break 300 EVs
So what are we gonna say... you’re fired? I want to make him cry :))))
Why do you guys keep saying the same numbers over and over?
He’s down by 90k?
"Hey, where did you hear that number?"
"The crazy thing is, the race is close enough that things like over-seas military ballots might actually matter. They have a longer time frame to get returned, so we may actually be stuck waiting around for a few days to know."
"When you put the ballot in the car, when you put the hand on their head so they don't hit the car, I say maybe don't be so nice."
I can hear it in his whiny voice.
Possibly ever
we might know if Biden gets ahead in PA tonight which is a for sure win. Just might not get a call from any media outlets
Philly SoS just stated in a livestream we won't have results till tomorrow
We will probably know by tomorrow.
Probably not
Definitely by next Christmas though
No one knows
Potentially
Most likely not.
"If Pennsylvania or Georgia turn out blue today, maybe. If not, we wait for Nevada’s numbers."
"Yes... I mean probably, we definitely will but there’s a chance we won’t."
"Don't we all right now, need to ease this anxiety somehow"
"God I respect the fuck out of that concession speech. However manufactured or fake you feel politics are, this sort of dignity in both victory and defeat has been sorely missed these last four years."
lmao it’s almost shocking to hear him talk about the Democrats like that. Like a different planet. We’ve fallen so far.
Absolutely not. He's going to go down crying and screaming and throwing tantrums lol
"No. But honestly, and as petty as it may be, I am going to saviour and enjoy every little tantrum and moment of desperation from now until he's gone."
Arizona not official yet
NV looks good for Biden. I'm honestly more worried about AZ flipping than Biden winning NV.
"Not if he loses Arizona, which is definitely in the realm of possibilities"
"That's true if you believe the AZ call, which Fox is sticking by. Not to sound like Karl Rove, but I think that fox made the call prematurely."

"If this happens I'd say they're almost guaranteed to splinter the GOP. A lot of them are hardcore Trump supporters but I would think some would see the lynchings and ditch the GOP. It's a weird bar to set, but some Nazis never turned good until they caught a glimpse of the horrors of the holocaust."
"50% of Americans don't want him to lead this country, it's more like 25%. Elections are unfortunately not representative of the population."
"50% of voters.  The country has over 300 million people, most of whom don't support his trash."

Writing an 8 using a figure 8 looks sloppy when you're presenting. Using 2 circles looks cleaner and more legible for viewers.

"More, daddy."
"Roger that, ""FUCK PAT BOONE!"""
That is literally what they think.  They're probably not that wrong.
In a way...they aren't wrong. We should be worried about all of the Trump judicial appointments
I needed that.
Good Billy Joel song
"Well I imagine the campaign paychecks stop pretty much right away, so... I won't speculate."

I have lived in Atlanta my entire life and I don’t know all of them. I think there are 20 or more.
link? their stream on youtube has no sound and is just race total images cycling for me
Biden will easily get 75%.
"I refuse to watch that channel, but curious as to who is fighting?"
That’s the end of their mail in date. We knew this.
"Same for NC. NC is accepting mail in ballots post marked by election day, until the, 12th."
Dang. At least PA should be done tomorrow
"Final day for mail-in ballots to arrive is Nov. 10th, postmarked by the 3rd."
Counting is hard...for real!
No excuse. Pure contempt and laziness.
Mail ins are probably allowed to arrive by then. That doesn't mean the race won't be called by then.
NV allows for ballots to arrive up to a week late (so the 10th) as long as they're postmarked. That's why.
"That's the final day they have to count them, and the deadline people have to resolve any issues like signatures mismatching."
Why is a state with 2.8 million people taking a lot longer than a state with 12.8 million? It isn’t that hard guys.
Way to become irrelevant
Ballots postmarked by election day are accepted until the 10th. He said the majority of ballots will be counted by Sunday (still way too long imo). The 12th is when he legally must have the count completed by.
Did they explain why?
"I have a crazy theory, there's 2 states that declare they will finalize by Nov 12.

they are waiting until everyone else declares blue/red, if Biden doesnt win PA/AZ and get the 270 votes then they might step in to save Trump's ass."
I fucking hate plurality voting
Rumors are that he’s announcing that he’s conceding.
Why would they not want to hear from fearless leader?
enough time to prepare the bingo cards
"Most of the reasonable people of America and the world won't even bother to tune in to hear about split milk and how the world and voting is just so unfair!  

Pull up the big boy pants Trump, your going to be abandoned by everyone you know pretty soon it looks like."
And slouching while looking down at my phone for 12 hours a day.
I've had a throbbing butt ache. Clenching my cheeks for 3 days does that.
My temples have hurt since Halloween. It's either brain cancer or election stress.. hard to tell.
Ugh me too. Started Tuesday night and has sidelined me since. It’s just now starting to let up. Hope you feel better soon.
"Same, my teeth hurt"
Tapper doesn't give a shit about Trump's loin droppings.
"Lolol earlier today one of the anchors called them his ""spawn"""

In trump time it's really gonna be an hour and a half. He's never on time.
Barron Trump?
"They keep using the word ""war"""
Getting very Saddam/Uday/Qusai vibes.
"At that point the GOP has to step in, right?"
"I got good news for you, no shoe eating for you"
"If he concedes, you can mail me half and I'll help you. I'd eat my own but shoes are expensive and I like the ones I have."
If he concedes I'll eat crow
Pretty safe bet
"You're pretty safe there, Riverboat"
God dammit 😂
All the Small Things must be Trump's campaign theme song
My friend lives in Montana oh how I wish 😔 but at least my state has medical so I can use it for my scoliosis pain
Thank god!  I've been so sick of winding up my clockwork lettuce!
Did you see what my home state did to the rest of their government? Ugg.
NYT shows the same: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-pennsylvania-president.html
Neither will change anything.
"He has already declared himself the winner of PA, MI, and GA.  He has also already said the plan is to get a case in front of the Supreme Court and expect ACB to come through for them."
yeah we’ve known that for like 2 months now
"If Nixon didnt go to jail, Trump won't.  If hes acquitted, the left will riot, if hes convinced the right will, the juice isnt worth the squeeze."
Which Georgia?
What is happening?
What!
What is
Not gonna happen. The GOP appears to have started distancing...
Sure Jan.
They're practically admitting to counting on him winning with a coup.
"thankfully we dont get fox news in the UK!

blessings"
I can't watch Fox for the same reason I can't watch shows like the Office: I get really uncomfortable with cringe-worthy stuff.
"It won't get crazy. For the vast majority of Americans, our elections and the transition of power is sacred."
I noticed you’re in Tennessee. I’m so sorry.
That’s exactly why they are lifetime appointments.
"Only the political pressure of their own biases, or situations where their family could benefit from their actions."
no chance he holds that lead.  Biden can get +5-10K there.
i think you're right
"There's no way

Edit: Jesus Christ, yes way"
He's actually already at 49.96%
Apparently those votes were from a redder area of the state too.
That's great because everytime he out-performs the target the target lowers for the next batch.
Are we sure about that 60?  The outstanding vote # seems fluid.
He needs 66% consistently. The total outstanding votes is wrong on the github site.
Yeah but just seeing on CNN that was 66% in a trump county.. so just imagine the blue county ratio.
Admiral! There be whales here!
More likely he calls for civil war but fun thought
I will eat a shoe
Not a chance in hell of that happening. He’s never going to concede.
and then hops on a jet to go live the rest of his life on an island to escape prosecution.
"If Biden takes AZ, NV, PA and GA Trump will concede.

If he takes anything less than that, Trump will not concede I reckon."
I'll be shocked. It'd be like seeing him recite the Lord's Prayer correctly from memory.
"I like to pick words, like bigly."
"Crooked

65%
"Over, id be surprised if he doesn't"
Over
I'd say it's at 75%
He never directly calls for anything - will he infer it? Sure.
Over/under 2.5 for racist dog-whistles in the speech?
over
"I'll take that, over."
Over for sure. Remember he did tell proud children to be standing by...
Stand back and stand over 30%.
Well he told them to stand back and stand by didn’t he?
I’ll take the over on that
Easy over

That'd be fucking hilarious if they dropped a large dump dooming his campaign.
That would be brilliant.
"Spot on. The one who did the firings will be soon fired in a big way. In party where loyalty means ""as long as it serves my goals"" this is to be fully expected. Use him to stay on top, throw under the bus when he loses, no longer useful. The next drain the swamper will blame everything on Trump, this time rightfully so."

"Without any Evidence, Trump says he's being cheated. Priceless"
He's lying about just about everything.
"People used to say stuff like being becoming POTUS has a way of elevating the individual, and turning them into something more than they were before, as a result of the great responsibility they must deal with every day for 4 or 8 years. Not just to the people who voted for him, but the responsibility to the nation, and to the world. I don't think people are going to say that ever again."
Definitely.
Yep
He can barely read. I don't think he's capable of setting anything up
"No, this sounds like he's trying to call a mulligan."
"Kind of...yet, I feel like states would have been extra careful this year to abide by all laws in order to avoid suits."
He looks pathetic and exhausted tbh
I do too. I think he's going to concede.
Clearly he's just too sleepy
Well you can't make it too obvious /s
That's probably why he's so mad. He didn't dissappear enough ballots.

"After seeing the sheer amount of votes Trump got, I agree. We needed a person that level headed republicans would go for. Bernie... I love him, but he isn't that man."
"No way that Bernie could be competitive in Arizona or Georgia. 

Democrats picked Biden because he is exactly the type of person who could take the fight to Trump in places like Texas and Georgia and survive a 2016-sized polling bias."
I'm a Democrat that HATES trump and if Bernie was the candidate I wouldn't have voted.
Yeah I love Bernie but he wouldn't win.
Bernie absolutely would've wiped the floor against Trump in either election
Bernie is so ahead of his time that I suspect he is a time traveler who was born in 2021 and sent back to try to stop Trump
"As I've been saying from the start, this election was not gonna be about making America into the country we want, it was about keeping it from falling further into a Trumpian hellscape. Biden was the right call for this election."
"According to mass exit poll data, Bernie would have mopped the floor with Trump in 2016. The DNC rigging the primaries to promote Hillary was one of the biggest mistakes they've ever made."
"Unfortunately your right, the moderate vote is deciding this election"
"Hard to say. This was a vote against Trump and for Covid action more than a vote for Biden. And a lot of Trump's support is actually old Bernie voters who were/are fed up with the status quo and, somehow, actually still think Trump is doing things like fighting corruption."
Agreed. I think Bernie's legacy is going to be the generation of Progressives he inspired and in the end I think that's going to be more important in the long haul.
"I still think Bernie could have won 2016, but I agree - he wouldn't have won this."
Not yet.

They are called bots
It's daily mail in TV format! Have you watched 'the five' *on fox yet? It's just comical
Guess which one is the most popular.
Welcome to our horrible world.
There is one oil change/car repair place I quit giving business to because they played Fox on their waiting room TV.
It's very clearly propaganda if you aren't inside that world already.
"CNN or other US cable news also do have their migraine moments, e.g. when they talk about universal health care because that would hurt their advertisers.

But Fox pretty much makes you understand why Americans would vote for Trump."
Small doses.
"And then remember, *they LOVE it*. 

It's absolutely bonkers."
Oh baby. This is the first time you've seen fox news?! Imagine watching that 7 hours a day. You'd think democrats were eating a fetus out of every good Christian woman and trump was the only thing standing between you and the immigrants.
"Everyone: My vote doesn't make a difference.

This election: Are you sure about that?"
"Yeah. There's some vote left from Republican counties but even that seems to be Democrat leaning. If Biden does eke out a lead from the mail-ins or even a narrow loss, we are going to have to wait on the provisional ballots, remaining overseas ballots to be delivered, and probably a recount to have a firm idea who won."
"I calculated that Biden will lose by about 6k votes if the outstanding county votes reflect the margins in them to date.

Really wanted a flip there but it is not required to win."
And Chatham County has the most.  Those alone might swing it when they finally dump.
"What I really like about this scenario is, with PA, GA, AZ and NV going for Biden, there is no path really for Trump to sue his way back into winning. You might have a case with one state where it is awfully close where you can flip it back with a lawsuit, but not 4 of them."
I see trump will win by between 1-4K. Harris county is done.
what makes you say that? There are only like 16k left and trump has a 10k lead. Are my numbers wrong?
"I can't agree with this more, they need to continue the count.

AZ and NV are an embarrassment"
"Exactly, this is taking entirely too long."
States take weeks to call their results. Some take until December. There's a long certification process.
"NYTimes has had him under 50% for the past four hours or so. But, looks like there'll be two runoffs in GA."
"Possibly, yes. You’d like to think there are steps being taken, anyway."
National guard is already on standby

"Almost for sure not, because trump runs the feds."
Doubtful?
Aww fuck. Definitely possible. I dont know if it would take that long though.
"No, they need to wait for GA to get to within thousands and see, or PA.  AZ wont be called till tomorrow and NV for another day or two potentially.  But GA will be pretty much decided by late tonight."
"Unlikely.  Remember who is currently in power.

I think it’s most likely that they are just being extra careful as the count remains so close this far into the tallying.

Also, if I was an election commissioner I would 100% count the easiest to count stuff first in the hope that it provides enough clarity to declare my state before we get to the slow nitty gritty work of the provisional ballots, ballots where we need to double check voter rolls to see if they voted in person and ended up cancelling their mail in ballot etc.

When it’s this close though, you still have to do all that, with the added scrutiny of media, stress of protestors nearby, and you know that if you make a mistake it looks even worse since every vote matters.  So you end up triple and quadruple checking things as you go."
nah
Speed at which they are counting varies!
"Or Pennsylvania, but hopefully AZ pulls through!"
"I care, I live here and want to see us Blue!"
"If we win GA and NV, but lose the rest, it’d be a tie. We still very much need AZ"

Are you trying to justify Trump going batshit anti-democracy currently?
Don't forget the other metro counties in the Atlanta metro area.
your words are divine and fill my heart with hope
Puts the Senate back in play.
"He's been staying below 50% and falling, runoff is all but inevitable."
Its more than possible. It's gonna be a run off for sure. More votes coming from Atl and a lot more from Savannah.
"very.  

said this before.

How would like to be him and that otheer gop gal having to do that runoff with an uhhinged lamee duck trump tweeeting crazy shit taking the gop down with him as he exits the whitehouse.   sucks for them.  they are doomed."

Yup
PA is dropping fast. 90k difference
"Yes, PA keeps dropping."
Yes
"Still looking good in PA if his current trend is sustainable, or if he only dips a little. All that's left in AZ is early drop-offs so it should be interesting. Nevada should be his, most remaining ballots are still from Clark County (Vegas). If AZ is truly his barring something terrible in Nevada then that's 270. Still a chance in GA too."
Yes

"Planning on:

And Philly is going like 90-10 in favor of Biden
Whether or not Biden wins Georgia entirely comes down to how many votes there are left to count. Biden is winning the votes that are still being counted overwhelmingly.
Depends on how many votes are left...
It’s 90k
"Regardless of the outcome, GA being in play for dems in future elections is going to be interesting."
Nevada clearly doesn't want it. Probably worried about rioting.
I feel the same about PA
"Too late, I'M ALREADY EXCITED!
Also, I have liquor in case the outcome is bad."

I'm not familiar with the GA Senate runoff rules. Does it go to runoff if no one gets 50%?
"I really hope it does, I live in GA and I’m gonna do everything I can to get people to vote blue in the special election"
Your wish has been granted.
That's because the PA city voting precincts are Very blue.
I hope they dedicate at least one skit to making fun of how slow NV is
recounts will always favor whoever won the election originally.
Good thing biden won’t need it if he either wins PA or holds AZ and NV. And for all we know he might get all 4

Maybe he’ll just storm out and quit
I'm nervous about that.
Lol no way he'll even face Biden. Too much of a pussy. But at least we'll get to see him depart the grounds forever.
Honestly hopes he spends the rest of his time with a burger and a TV.

Whichever state is first to be called is most likely to have violence from trump supporters.

It's normal and traditional
"Standard practice, doesn't mean much."
Too little too late.

"Probably will say that Biden cheated, and will try to put him in jail to stop him becoming president or something stupid."
Probably hereby declare this election invalid
He's buying another casino to bankrupt.
Fraud. Stop counting. Etc.
I’m just afraid that Biden still has a chance at trumping this election. Things are looking optimistic though.

"I don't know about in the US, but in the UK a trump is a fart"
Gonna describe scumbag activity as Trumpian.
We all need to chip in and send that man plenty of alcohol.
The votes to come in do favour Trump. Will they be enough? Who knows....
I think its wishful thinking
Not all absentees are equal. The ones in AZ trend slightly Trump.
"That's not how the last few batches of votes from Maricopa have come in. AZ is bucking the blue shift trend in mail in so far. I have to imagine it'll stop trending red. But it has. People have been saying ""the remaining vote is blue"" for over 24 hours, yet the lead has shrunk."
"Maricopa County may appear to lean blue, but there are many conservatives that live in suburbs outside of Phoenix, and snow birds / retirees as well. If it happens to be that votes from THOSE people are the ones yet to be counted, it works in Trump's favor."
Some people feel the remaining vote in Maricopa county will be more right-leaning.
I think people are just being cautious. Some overly so.
"They’re doomscrolling. That and CNN hasn’t called it. But you’re right, Arizona is staying Blue"
He's averaging a higher vote percentage than he needs to win the state
"A lot of people use mail-in ballots in AZ and the number of Republicans that RECEIVE mail-in ballots is higher than dems, they have to count to see how many actually used their mail-in ballots, it’ll be extremely close, closer than PA I think"
"the main reason is that mail-in votes will come from anywhere in the state, as mail-in ballots were sent to everyone in the state. it is unlikely that it would all break for trump, but is not totally predictable, so mostly just caution."
Don't worry. AZ is def leaning Biden
My sincere worry is that he says something like “calling on all patriots to stop the counting by force”
I wouldn't mind a Budd Dwyer ending.
">Election is rigged  
>  
>He's fighting to get the votes not counted

It's going to be a meltdown for the history books that's for sure
I dunno. Something about the way his mouth moves makes it look like a puckering asshole.
"Yes, it's extremely likely"
Absolutely
Yep.
Is very realistic. Very probably.
Yes
Good shot in PA. Decent/small shot at GA. Pretty confident in NV and AZ.
"If current percentages hold, Biden has a pretty clear victory there... so yeah, it's pretty realistic right now."
Yes
It’s just a matter of time
Yes.
"If Biden keeps racking up the same margins on mail-in ballots, and if the number of uncounted mail-in ballots is correct, then yes it’s simple math that he will pull ahead. 

There are also provisional day-of ballots that will be counted after mail-ins, unknown how many of those there are and where they are."
I’m up for that.

That’s such a good sign. Let’s go PA!
I feel like the counties with est remaining and result updates via the media pool may not be causally linked.

"Nah he doesn't want to lose, he might actually be prosecuted"
"Ah yes, because going on a firing spree makes you look *so* presidential."
This was actually super fun.
He wouldn’t even concede if it was a major blowout.
Should but won't
"He will never officially concede. He will hand over the keys, but never congratulate and then disappear. Hopefully to NY state prison, but Russia with no access to his Twitter account would be just as good."

You mean Y'all Qaeda.  Also learned google spell check with check y'all qaeda.
"Hah!

Perfect"
"Sounds about right. If the ~70% for biden continues, he will overtake by 40k."
326k left to count. Doesn't mean all the totals have been reported of votes already counted
Yep
Yeah it’s basically guaranteed his the numbers have been on his side all day
Just follow this: [https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html)
I’m going by [this](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html) which says Biden needs about 60%.
"Unless some really insane shift, PA is blue.

> 2020-11-05 22:53  ***  Trump leading by 78,314 votes   Remaining (est.): 394,532    Change:  35,858 (Trump 33.7% / 66.3% Biden)   Precincts: 8229/9128  Biden needs 59.92% [-0.534%]  Biden recent trend 66.33%

This is UTC, so just 20 minutes ago. Biden has been over performing the ratio he needs to level consistently by 10%. I did a bit of modeling an hour ago. If the trends continues, Biden is about to win by about 130k. 

This is the only website you need:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper/master/battleground-state-changes.txt"
As long as those numbers are all accurate than yes your math is correct. Biden is highly favored to win PA as he has been winning 70-80% of the votes in PA lately.
"Your maths is all correct, but you said he needs to win half plus 80k instead of half plus 40k!"
"Several flaws.  There are provisional ballots that raise the total to almost 400k.  Biden has been winning mail ins by 80/20, and provisionals will be even higher.  That doesn’t include ballots still coming in the mail.  There is nothing to sweat here."
“I like beer”
Fuck that rapist
ACB leading them in scripture
That's because they are accepting mail in ballots for quite awhile after the election. I think 11/10?
Biden could win both GA and PA. We may not even need Nevada lmfao
As I understand it they've counted all their ballots in hand.  Now they wait for the mail to bring more.  Anything postmarked by election day and arriving up to 7 days later is valid.
they are hoping it doesnt come down to them and odds are it doesnt so they just want to slow burn it to avoid the AZ situation I am sure
lol you really think trump is gonna go the blm route?
"The authorities are actively on the goons side, unfortunately"
Absentee ballots in trump's country also favor Biden. He just got 11K plus from a trump county cutting it down to 78K.
biden closed in by 20k votes in red counties to!
I hate that this isn't off reality...

Clark County is still blue. I believe it. It’s still heavily contested with republicans though.
"> Nevada - Not 100% sure. However, I'm pretty sure one of Nevada's election officials said you won't see anything until tomorrow morning at 10am. According to pollster, Biden is heavily favored to win based on the type of votes coming in.

Yes. The secretary of state tweeted that 90% of remaining ballots are from Clark County, very heavily D. https://twitter.com/EmmaKinery/status/1324463595615330304

There is no strategy. You can’t stop counting votes. That’s not how this works.
"I think they are pinning their hopes on PA not flipping so they can lobby faithless electors, to defect. Biden wins PA and he can't do that. SC probably isn't going to do what he wants them to do. Those three justices will be loyal to the party and Mitch..not Trump."
AC: why tho
"They are peacefully protesting. It's a ridiculous cause, but it's a peaceful protest."
Lmao I wish. That would be dank as fuck.
that got dark.
Shouldnt Biden get 320k and Trump 80k of the remaining?
could you imagine if he did
That really wouldn't do anything though. Pence takes over and rides the rest of way.
No way he ever admits he lost.
Holy shit that would be awesome

That was the plan. Trump and the Republicans told their voters not to vote by mail for exactly for this.

"He's painting a picture of ""I will lose Georgia because of illegal votes"". The moron doesn't realize if he wins it, it's by his word, that it was because of illegal votes then.."

We don't update til we collect all ballots and count which will br next Thursday
"Not counting, giving ballots time to come in. They start the 12th"
They haven't received all their ballots yet.
NC has a huge grace period on taking in mail in ballots.
Their contracts expired at midnight of 11/3
"I think they just decided it was easier to count a large batch and report all at once. There was an update earlier that they wouldn't report again until Friday, I believe."
"Our deadline for mail-ins is November 12th, as long as the ballot is postmarked by the 3rd. Conjecture, but it might have to do with that."
They can accept votes for like a week after election day. Theyre waiting for the mail.
"Fort Bragg (huge base in NC) has a ton of active duty registered voters who vote from overseas by absentee, so NC gives until Nov 12 to get those in and counted."
They aren’t going to count until the 12th/13th as that’s the deadline they have for receiving properly postmarked ballots/absentees/etc
Votes in NC can be counted up until November 12. They won’t be releasing any numbers until then.
They are not. NC allows late mail-in ballots and they are waiting for them to turn up. I believe we will hear from them on the 11th.
"Nothing to count.  It prolly could be called for Trump. 

There are 116k mail ballots sent to voters and they could be received, correctly postmarked.  Trump has a 76k lead."
They want someone else to give the election to Biden
There upset because all eyes on Nevada!
"NC is allowed to collect votes until the 12th as long as they were postmarked by election day, so they're allowed to take their sweet time."
They won’t update again until the 12th.

"For god's sake, reddit on the toilet."
Do you know how many ballots are left to count?

Possible for sure. I think it’s definitely possible Trump holds on though
I think its like a 70% shot
"Pretty good, he's overperforming right now"
"Which is leaning blue also, very likely now that Biden flips Ga"

PA will be first.
Which one?
Me too. Good old times.
That was a great thread.
"Don’t worry, there will be 50 more to catch up on... at this rate."
45 was shorter
U might wanna see a doctor then man
How many left to count?
I was looking and he could potentially be up by like 20k at the end of it
And historically recounts have never ever ended up in changed results
I'd be fine with that. Lets rub it in Trumps face.
"Georgia doesn't have an automatic recount.

A candidate may request one if the margin is .5% or lower.

It is probable that one will be done, especially if it's looking like 2000 Florida margins."
Care to expand? Im always game for a laugh!
That would actually make Republican voters even more enthusiastic to keep the Senate out of Democrats hands.
And depending on how much Donald goes insane his actions might actively hurt the candidate too...
Enough 😀
47k as of a few hours ago.  So probably around 40k now would be my guess.
"43,000ish uncounted, 9525 margin"
1%
Enough
About 18k I last heard
"Look here:  [https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html)

You can see that the outstanding ballots count hasn't always been reliable. But if this is correct, we need to keep Trump down at 17k of the last 43.6k."
"About 40,000"
Does that include Chatham's numbers?

"A press conference like NV had, not a winner announcement."

I will root for Georgia sports teams for the next 10 years if GA goes blue.

I still can't believe one of the counties in PA are taking a day off from counting.  Like wtf do they have that's more important.

They are waiting for fuhrer instruction.

"I've curiously gotten *more* sleep.

"Bye don, make a third party on your way out to splinter the GOP vote pls and thx"
I think its a ploy to stay out of prison. If anyone comes after Trump he'll claim that he's a political prisoner and that Biden is just locking up his enemies.
There's no way he runs again and there's no way the RNC gets him be the candidate.
I didn't know inmates can run for President...
Good luck without Twitter or Fox
"There is a reason why there has been one president with non-consecutive terms.  By then, there is a good chance his moment would have gone by.  The media is going to focus on the new administration.  He needs to prepare himself for major legal issues.  Deutsche bank has already said they will demand repayment and if he can't, they will seize his assets.  Who knows what the NY AG has."
If the next administration/SDNY has the balls to fry his ass in court then he'll be too busy knocking back cockmeat sandwiches... but that's wishful thinking
I actually came in here to ask if anyone else saw it.  It was like a fever dream

Is this betting odds or number of votes lol
I had 5000 up but that was yesterday.
Alaska doesn't count mail in ballots until a week after the election. It's a big fucking state with a lot of remote towns.
"My guess is that it's a huge, sparsely populated place which has towns and individual areas that are really really hard to access, i'm sure it just takes time to get the frontier vote."
"""Voters who visit early voting stations through Oct. 29 will have their ballots counted on Election Day. Early votes cast after that date — and all absentee ballots — will not be counted until at least Nov. 10.""

This is not a suprise. They are in no hurry.

ptsd from 2016
NPR is showing it for Biden I think following AP
"Biden is 90k behind PA
wqhats your point

I mean  Biden has mail-in ballots it seems but Trump is gaining at a decent amount compared to what he needs too."
Because the trend line lately is biting into Biden's lead.
"2020s been a helluva year. 

Can’t blame some people for assuming the worst."
Because it was called very early on and the vast bulk of pundits and news agencies have refused to call Arizona for Biden
"Because there are over 400K ballots to be counted, Trump would need 57.72% to flip the state, and he is currently averaging 58.5%."
"Because there are around 400k mail-in ballots to be counted; and unlike other states, AZ has a long history of Republicans voting by mail, so Biden’s margins aren’t as drastic with these returns as in other states. Trump could potentially close the gap since he’s trending high enough."
"It is the percentage of votes Trump needs of the outstanding votes that gives Trump a chance at winning AZ. The last amount of ballots that were released gave enough for Trumo to narrow his lead and so if that trend continues he could win. Tonight if the next update for ballots shows the trend continues then it is even more likely, however if Biden gets a higher percentage (like mail in votes in other states seem to show) then that seems less likely."
"Narrowing margins are a bit scary. Biden is still the favourite, but I suspect everyone is supercharged with the rollercoaster this election has been."
Hundreds of thousands of votes outstanding. Trump needs to win the remaining ballots by 60% to win. The last batch of votes to come in he won by 60%.
"Because there's a slight chance Biden won't flip PA or GA, and if that happens AND he loses AZ, we get 4 more years of Trump."
"[https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html)

If you check average block trend and hurdle of Arizona, you will see there is a small chance of it flipping to Trump."
"Just beware though, you may have to live in Georgia."
No thanks
We can just get a bunch of Silicon Valley peeps to buy cheap houses in blighted areas and switch their registration from CA to GA.

"The problem is he's not ahead in Nevada or Arizona, meaning Biden wins if we stop all the votes."
He went full tin foil on election night and his sons are calling for civil war. This isn’t going to be teleprompter trump.
"Winner of what? PA and GA? Biden is leading and if votes stopped he'd have AZ, NV and 270 electoral votes."
He IS officially behind in the polls. If counting were to stop right now Biden would win.
He’s declared victory multiple times and not even fox has really went with it
I want them to drop them right before Trump takes the stage!
Love me a fat dump

"Hell, look no further than his attempt to completely gut the post office to destroy mail in ballot potential. He slowed down mail all over the country, and notably in Philadelphia mail was slowed by as much as 5 days. It can't be a coincidence that the 8th circuit federal court passed down a ruling about not allowing Wisconsin's (i think it was WI) extending the acceptable time to receive mail-in ballots for them to be counted"

Haven’t seen pence since election night
Pence is saving his political career and good for him. It's the smartest thing to do tbh
where where ???
He wouldn't last a day.  He would get torn up by Trump crazies.  But man would that be amazing.
Pence is spineless though.
the 2020 twist we all have earned.
He should have the fly do it.
What's the 25th? (Brit here)
that would be amazing 😭🙏🏽
He has to get the Cabinet
Let's assume Trump puts up a lot of roadblocks to a transition.  It seems like it would be in Pence's interest to do that and make it seem like he is the voice of reason for a 2024.  Otherwise i see Pence just disappearing until the primaries for 2024 start.
He does not have the authority.
Tits up for Trump

His people don’t want to pay taxes but they would 100% pay for his expenses the next 4 years at the drop of a hat."
He would mainly hold rallies for some income and donations. Can't see what else he could do make money.

They're literally allowing if not requiring both D and R official watchers at the polls. No shit you can't just have anybody and everybody be able saunter into the poll stations.
"Never mind the fact that each party has official certified observers to watch the count. So basically, the Trump campaign is saying, ""we don't trust our own observers."""
"Just fought with someone on FB about this. He’s sharing a story of a friend who is a poll watcher that wasn’t allowed to watch the count. That’s not the poll watcher’s job. Until a court order today, they didn’t HAVE to let them observe. They’ll do anything to twist the narrative."
And not masking

Sure, some on the right did it to those on the left, but we should be leading by example and turning the other cheek. 
 
I do hope the election goes in Bidens favor, but that doesn't mean I want to laugh at those who lost. Their distress about the potential loss has real-world implications, and we need to figure out how to build bridges with them."
"It’s amazing, really. They are going to go full conspiracy after Biden wins. I don’t feel bad for them all."
"Lol they’re like “if Biden wins he’s cheating :(“ while also saying stuff like “dems made it too easy to vote” and not getting the correlation about how the increase in mail in ballots, none of which could be counted before Election Day, would make things slower.

You can absolutely sign executive orders to undo all of Trump's executive orders therefore effectively nullifying that portion of his presidency. He can undo all of the damage Trump did to industrial regulations. Those judicial appointments will probably never go away but he has the power of the pen if Congress refuses to play ball.
"Republicans will do a 180 and start condemning executive orders since their """"""standards"""""" only apply to Democrats in power."
He can certainly undo all of Trump's EOs.
or use the four years to build a massive dem base
"Yes, but they are limited in power. Trump ruling by fiat was largely ineffective as the courts tied up a lot of his attempts to overreach and violate rights. Without a cooperating legislature, like Trump has had since 2018, nothing substantial gets done. 

Best we can hope without the Senate is that Biden can return our various departments and agencies to competence and reverse much of Trump’s horrible EOs."
Honestly people keep saying it won't matter without the Senate. Fuck that! No more Barr. No more kushner. No more trumps! Actual diplomacy on a world stage
A decent president doesn’t throw around EO’s
I would like if he hired Hunter as a senior advisor!
I'd like to know this as well
Senate controls appointments (judicial and administrative) and the power of the purse.
"Executive orders mean absolutely nothing. They don't allow the president to just do whatever, they're completely powerless"
he can also replace a lot of shitty Trump appointments
"Can't get big stuff done without the Senate. Covid relief, healthcare, immigration reform. Maybe infrastructure would be possible but I'm guessing the GOP will suddenly care about the deficit again and not want to approve any new spending"
Prob could but will the dems have the spine to? Probably not
[deleted]
"Yeh, but trump had a republican senate"
Executive orders tend to be less comprehensive forms of legislation and often have less impact than laws passed in the legislative branch.
"Could he? Yeah. Would he? Probably not. He will cancel a bunch of trump's, but for new policy he's all about 'reaching across the aisle' and 'forming a bipartisan coalition'"
"Laws are permanent, EO just get undone by the next guy. Can't pass laws with turtle dick in charge."
"Passed laws are better since they stick around after the president leaves. But yeah, Biden can get things started using executive orders."
"Yes but there are a lot of things that cannot be fine by executive order. Those things have to be approved by the legislature. So yeah Biden can do some things by executive order, but a lot of his agenda will be handicapped by the republican senate. Unless Democrats win the 2 Georgia run off elections, then we have a tie in the senate. The VP gets to cast the tie breaking vote, so that would effectively give democrats senate control. It’s still a possibility."
The real game is to add someone like Susan collins to the cabinet and then be able to appoint a democratic senator.   Won't happen but a guy can dream.
"The issue with executive orders is they aren't as permanent as laws. The next President who comes in after you can just cancel every executive order you issued.

For meaningful and lasting changes to policy and law, it needs to go through Congress."
And trump did that and got nothing done
"Trump’s EOs are hollow. Obama had some good ones. It’s a pretty limited tool when it comes to big, expensive plans like infrastructure and climate change.

The Senate is just as important as the presidency, and we fell short. Biden/Democrats will have a very hard time getting their agenda through.

I’m not sure anything could have been done differently though. I don’t think any other candidate would have fared any better, and voter turnout was record-breaking. I think conservatives came out in force mainly to protect the Supreme Court."
"Executive orders can all be reversed by the next president. They can be contested in front of a hostile Supreme Court. They can be held up by Fox as examples of anti-democratic abuses of power, because consistency doesn't matter to Fox and its audience. And they can't apply to everything. I doubt he could use an executive order to create an agency from thin air rather than reshuffling an existing one. He couldn't use it to reform the Senate or Supreme Court. He couldn't use it to change income tax rates.

For some examples of their other limitations, all the protected environmental areas that got bulldozed by Trump's wall or resource extraction aren't coming back just because the next president puts them under protection again. All the scientists and professionals Trump fired can't drop everything at their new jobs to pick up their old work where they left off. And why would they when the next administration could fire them all over again? Without legislation backing them up, executive orders are just a way to keep government agencies operating for the time the president is in office. After that any progress can be wiped away, sometimes forever."
maybe the president should think  ~~before he tweet~~
oh john..
All hail King John!
"But he's not going to do that, lol"
Think it’s a little late for that
"Hes not the only one too. Sean Parnell, a very frequent guest on Fox, isn't conceding to Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania."
"James lost to Stabenow 2 years ago, the GOP keeps trying to put this empty canvas into the senate"
Ok. Fine. No requirement that he does. He can be a petulant child about it all he wants and make up all the stupid shit he wants but he also has to be able to prove it if he wants it to work.
"Lol one of my neighbors has a little horse field with a giant ""Ridin' with Biden"" sign"

The remaining votes are not from the Atlanta area?
"Not ENTIRELY spent. Probably about 3 or 4k back to biden net, and then the rest will be to Savannah."
"I'm guessing that's Chatham County? If so, they leaned blue by 17k votes in 2016 so here's hoping."
There's still a few more to squeeze out.

"Well no shit.

If he concedes he's going to jail.

So we'll have to drag him out of there."
We knew this all along.
Good thing that doesn't matter
Of course not. That's why he put an unclimbable wall around the White House -- so they couldn't drag him out by force.
I’m not sure what the constitution says about how to evict a president.  I guess after inauguration of the new one? Does DC eviction law prevail?

still about 37k to go. i think so
Not optimistic anymore although he does still have savanna
its rough but could happen if we have one percent of the vote left thats like 50k ballots so if biden can pull 60-40 on those he wins out by less than 1k

What are the current numbers?
Good point. That is like a 5k swing alone.
Because we won't know NC until next week so no reason to go crazy over it right now.
Because it'll take many days to hear if NC actually flips. The election will be decided by then. I think NC won't start counting until November 10th.

"I would have thought engineers would be more logical folk, as a group."
"I wonder if it's a symptom of engineers usually being a bit socially excluded, which leads to the kind of bitterness that the right wing is feeding on."
I mean engineers are white men (largely). That's a demo trump outperforms in across incomes.
"I think it often depends on the degree people get. STEM degrees are of course very advanced and require a lot of intelligence, but there isn't as much human analysis and emotional thinking involved as an arts degree such as English, History, Social Sciences etc (of course no disrespect to STEM- its just a different type of intelligence). 

I think someone with a sociology degree would have a lot harder time voting for Trump as their degree allows them to see firsthand the problems in society and empathise with those affected. People in Stem also don't need to study these social problems in their degree, so they're less affected by them.

Just my 2 cents, I'm not sure how accurate this is."
"It usually boils down to finances. Engineers often command decent six figure salaries and the less taxes (and regulations, depending on the engineering career) is attractive for that.

It’s why there’s a sizable libertarian mantra in the industry I work (biotech). Socially liberal but fiscally as conservative as it gets."
I work in finance/brokerage firm and I’d argue trump support is pretty high in this field
engineer and trump hater here. your math does not check out. 😉
"I work in big tech and there are a lot of quiet libertarian types here, probably more than liberals. Finance is split between centrist types and conservatives who may find Trump’s assholery funny but may also find his ineptitude embarrassing"
I am a mechanical engineer and it's the opposite on my side. Most if them I know are democrats.
"Intelligence is not all encompassing. Some can be intelligent in some areas, and incredibly stupid in others. Emotional intelligence is especially important since it can't really be taught unlike many other forms."
"I have two engineers in my family that voted blue, but the engineers my bf works with are all Trump supporters."
"It goes back to money. I'm in engineering as well and my colleagues are more concerned about higher taxes, even though it won't impact them. These people don't look closer into the impacts a party might have on them. If someone says, hey, dems are coming after you by raising taxes, they'll get spooked, especially in a field that usually pays out more."
"there are different kinds of Trump supporters. Some are just fucking idiots. Some are very smart, but they are selfish assholes. They don't care about what's best for the country just what they perceive as immediately beneficial to them personally. Then you've got some that are just plain racist or bigots. 

A Trump supporter is generally some combination of those three things."
Fellow engineer here. Most engineers have their heads up their own ass. Trump fits their personality.
Intelligence and wisdom are different stats for a reason
"my guess would be that has more to do with geography, my brother is an engineer and has lots of engineer friends and theyre all extremely liberal, but they grew up in liberal areas. on the other hand i watch some engineers on youtube and stuff and some are from places like alabama and they all seem like pretty big trump people"
"I don't know what a civil engineer is, nor how a civil engineer is different from any other engineer, but it's a well known phenomenon that engineers are very prone to belief in conspiracy theories. My guess is that they heavily lean Republican."
"I'm in Aerospace and my experience has been that Trump supporters are a rare bird, although to be fair most engineers that I know live in New England, Washington, or California."
Maybe they work in oil and gas?
Right? I keep looking at this guy in PA and find it so animated and amusing. It's primarily his facial expressions that go along with the sign language.

"Nobody cares about Alaska? 

...no, seriously. All eyes are probably on the BG states ATM. 

Also, as it seems to stand, only 47% of the votes in Alaska have been reported.

Why not call it Unpainted Huffhines?
"error'd!

Man all eyes are on PA right now i guess"
Do we really have to wait 900 years? I'm not sure we'll still be around by then...
I don't think I want to wait that long..
"I hope I live to see it, but probably won’t unless I can figure out how to upload my brain into one of those giant clams that lives 1000’s of years."
bit of a wait.
All votes matter
I live in an area that is about as Trump heavy as it gets. Very testy here and very funny to observe.

Lookup the tip line for your local FBI office and phone it in.
So 2012 again?
"And the Dems need to roll with everything into GA over the next few months for a Senate majority.

Winning both seats means 50-50 immediately and 52-50 shortly after."
6 adult feet or baby feet?
Friday last i heard.
"I saw someone earlier say Chatham won't be reporting until tomorrow, altho I can't give you a source on that"
Who's word is it?
Source
Wasserman doesn't even seem to be talking about if Biden will win. He's now moved onto the size of the polling error.
2020 looking more like 2018 than 2016
For those not watching they are saying that if Biden’s trend of 78% of mail in votes continues he will flip Pennsylvania by more than 40 thousand votes
"Georg Ian [last name] for a boy.

Not a bad name actually."
Did you happen to comment this a day ago because I think I saw it before
Georgia is a cute name for girls tho.
Is it back to 100k or under 100k?
Can we win with just 326k left?
How many of those counties are liberal
"Are these majority blue? 

What's the final on PA gonna look like? Biden will win?"
"Source?

I recall CNN mentioning Philly and Allegheny and it matches your numbers.  But is your source an external website or Twitter account?"
"That's only 198k, where's the rest?"
"And this is ALL mail in correct?  Which has been going to Biden at a 3-1, almost 4-1 ratio?"
Oh my god we so have this
"“We always hated Trump, he was a monster”"
"Exactly. I've heard this guy from PA say ""segregation"" a ton of times in just like... two minutes. *facepalm*"
They wont count until the 12th
"They said they wouldn’t update for a week or so, approx. the 12th"
They have a deadline of Nov 12 for mail in ballots postmarked by election day so we wont get final tallies until then.
"Barely anything is moving except PA and GA. NV, AZ, and NC are just sitting there."
I don't think we hear from them until the 13th.
"From what I know, NC mail-in ballots have to be postmarked by the 3rd, but they have till the 12th to be counted. So I think NC is waiting to release any further non-election day votes until after the deadline"
"Unless I misheard, I coulda sworn Tapper also said “spawn” earlier."
"Tapper said ""Trump's spawn"" earlier and I lost it. Such shade. Love it."
"Play that again Alexa, I love that song"
"From what I understand it's not about not letting observers in, it's that there needs to be democratic, republican and independent observers in equal number in the room.  So 50 dem, 50 rep and 50 independent for example.  So you can't just flood the room with 100 more republicans because 1) that would violate equal number of representatives and 2) may exceed the rooms legal # of people allowed (room occupation limits for safety)"
"that's the thing though, there are observers for both parties at all these locations they just want more I guess?"
Rumor is he is going to announce conceding.
We're...#....1?
Yes.
Gotta have something to brag about because these results will not be in their favor
Yup!!
And yet he seems like the most reasonable Republican so far. Shows how far down they’ve gone
Will it be called tonight???
How much do they have to swing blue? And what is the current trend?
With a 90k spread.
So Biden just needs 64% of the remaining votes. That sounds pretty doable
"Biden is down 90,000ish in PA. This is going to be close :("
Toomey is a POS
He’s an idiot and has been for years.
Scrotorum?
"Yeah, Santorum seemed to know PA was blue, this guy seemed completely oblivious."
I would give anything to see GA called for Biden at 6:25pm.
Resignation before defeat is announced?
A shit show incoming.
Got it 653pm
That should be fucking wild
Asking his followers to no longer stand by.
So no lid? Interesting.
Als per his official scheudle: [https://twitter.com/AndrewFeinberg/status/1324484118483292168](https://mobile.twitter.com/AndrewFeinberg/status/1324484118483292168)
They don't want riots in their state.
Yes.
They have to get those election bets in over the weekend and veterans day.
Are they kidding?
"He's announcing his plans for transition of power.


1. Hide in bunker

2. Feed wife and Blondi a cyanide capsule. 

3. Eat cyanide capsule and shoot self before the Americans or Russians can get there."
oh i cant wait
Oooh shit here we go
">Trump is making a statement at 6:30 est 

Will announce his running mate for 2024 according to Fox news"
What platform will he be on?
I hope the AP calls Nevada at 6:29
"I mean, it will get them riled up, but it's not going to make the counting stop or change the numbers."
whats that going to solve? the ballots have been cast. No one can help him with votes beyond those who have already done so.
Sooo...what do you think will go down?
"""You stole ma election. I'm cancelling democracy for poor ratings."""
where can i watch?
I'm just over the theatricals of it all.
I hope it’s called literal seconds before he speaks.
I'd love to see that just to see Trump's meltdown live!
My gay ass can’t
[deleted]
"Lol at the rate PA is going, it's not out of the question that it will happen while he's speaking."
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
OMG. Could you imagine. It would be priceless
Ga ain't happening today. It's too close. It's recount territory. It's going to be +/- 1k votes I think
i can only hope!
"Not just white women, but all women, and also all minorities across the board. He only lost ground with white men."
"This is what worries me. I don't think his legal challenges will go anywhere, but it's sending a message to his supporters. They take everything he says at face value."
and donuts.
Is this gonna be the breaking news: Shark Week of the new decade?
That's technically still election coverage if it's a metaphor
Don't have fox here. What are they doing?
I bet he hasn’t slept at all
It'll have to be teleprompter.
Look at this car crash
Just give him a football painted bright green and call it good.
"1...2...3...4...5...

It's like the combination an idiot would have on his luggage!"
"Hopefully the higher ups would ignore him or put him under arrest. The boys at the bottom are rigorously selected to follow commands. If you tell them to launch the missile, they launch the missile."
FBI should arrest Fat Joffrey for incitement to commit murder.

"[yes, yes](https://imgur.com/a/2DEtmL6)"
Georgia has corrected to 36k.  Might be a tad harder.
"The math shows not only is it doable, but it’s going to happen"
Where? I need to see this.
Their just throwing darts at the wall on those lawsuits
"Nah, you would prefer it during. Because some poor soul would interrupt to tell him and he'd explode live in real time."
"Stop, my penis can only get so erect."
"And wouldn't you know it, Trump is going to speak soon. Buckle up buckaroos :("
He's pretty much begging to get struck by lightning saying that.
we would have known who won on Tuesday at 10PM ET and what's the fun in that!
Ya but more like 6:45
He'll probably try to pull the 80s business power move and make everyone wait until 7pm
yes
Yes
"If it's like the daily briefings we had been getting for a while, expect it around 7."
Yes.
The poor boys?
That's definitely on the bingo card
Jake Tapper is amazing
It would be but it isn't happening
have a feeling GA and PA are waiting 1 min before Trump goes live just to do that
I want Fox to call PA during the middle of his speech and an aide walks up to tell him mid speech
The same way I draw a pair of balls
He’s left handed
2 circles?
That is how we all draw 8s now
Cumberland mostly red county?
If those PA votes were from Cumberland it is absolutely fucking over
"Go, Delco, go! It’s not often I’m proud of my hometown but this is one of them!"
I will believe that Peter Dinklage will beat LeBron James in basketball before I believe Trump will concede
That's a frightening thought.
"ok, and? He's gonna have to do a HELL of a lot better than that to not lose this race."
"More evidence that AZ was called too early.  However, it does still appear likely that Biden will take it."
"Hey all, I am here to report we are still waiting..."
"Agreed. I feel bad for all of our journalists, honestly. They must be so exhausted. I know I am, and I'm just watching this shit."
John King? Dude is a legend
"I think he waits four years for this and every Election Day Eve he’s just like “Alright, buddy. It’s our time to shine!”"
Clearly never had a big curry night
This man doesn't Taco Tuesday
I need that. Imagine if this is your job and you have to be calm. I am a pretty steely eyed Internet badass. I race cars and have a blue belt on BJJ... and have trained MMA. Fighting people is less stressful than this. I am sure you do what you need to... but holy
There is also the possibility of provisional ballots in Philly and surrounding areas to run up the score after mail in!
he also did say georgia still may stay trump.  its going to be real close in georgia.
Wouldn't be his first imaginary scapegoat
Why has Fox turned their back a bit against Trump this time?
Co-workers were already doing this today haha
"but the polling had a significant error again this year lol, if anything trump benefited from the polling error."
It's gonna get ugly.
same im finished with trump
"Yeah please, I can't stomach listening to him."
"It'll just be whine, whine, whine.

Then he's going to ask his proud boys to be proud.

And will probably break a dozen federal laws in the process."
"you can't fire me, I quit!!"
Please loan us Jacinda.
And if he declares martial law and sends troops to the counting locations...
John King has earned his break.
While he’s talking!
the black panther line got him
"Do you think he calls in to Trump and asks “Did I do good, daddy?”"
Ewww
"Don't stop, I'm close"
I think it should be a right to bear cool CDs
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
More likely he pulls a daenerys with the bells ringing.
"No. The party will quietly distance him, but nothing so drastic. They'd upset too many of their voters if they turn on him at the last second.

They built an army of crazed tinfoil hat types, now they have to ride that tiger."
Unlikely the house wastes time with impeachment
"25th Amendment, followed by a Federal pardon from President Pence."
"Apologies, I'm in the UK with limited TV access, what did McConnell say?"
"They could, especially to save face"
"If he loses, they will condemn him, if he wins they will fall back in line."
"Sure, they could impeach him up to the very last day of his term if they wanted to."
72M Americans agree.
Nope he will declare himself the winner
"""I won the 2nd place. I'm a winner. Silver medal is a big deal. Silver is cool.""

\- Trump"
"The regular analysis is pretty neutral, and even pointed out that Trump was wrong that nobody was allowed in the polling place, but the talking head shows are being obnoxious"
https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/
IDK how much longer they're going to keep voting. It's starting to get late on the East Coast.
"He is close to loosing Georgia, but we have not seen a full update on numbers from Georgia yet"
I guess Fox could call it and that would do it but AZ really shouldn't be called like they have it. It's still up in the air too much.
"Good, because he's still rambling nonsense and throwing out lie after lie to see what sticks."
I love this typo
"Dont do that number down with letters, 69000000"
MSNBC cut him off almost right away.
With a capital C.
Sadly this couldn't be farther from the truth
Awww yiss
PA down to <74k.
PA now at 64K!
How many votes left?
they gave him a speech to read and he's fucking it up
Fox news and Murdoch goon brainwashing 69M peoples in this country
It's cute you think the average American has anything resembling actual intelligence.
where???
Holy fuck me
Same. He sounds so fucking hoarse.
Is that the margin???
Source?
January? Honey the race for the Senate starts tomorrow and we all shut our mouths and let Stacey Abrams tell us where we should stand.

"Now that you mention it, has anybody seen him the last few day?"
"Even he can't get behind that. That was a declaration of war on democracy. If you want war, Trump, you'll get it."
I think that last speech broke him
Did he?  I’m at work and cnn is muted
I mean its cause he knows enough to know 45 is likely done. He's a rat jumping off the ship
Basically that Trump is full of it.
His son has already started [https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1324480774821826561](https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1324480774821826561)
He has been the past two days
"His family already have been, they deleted the tweets though."
Really? Awesome! I've been worrying about it flipping red
I don't think that 75k value is correct. Should be closer to 25k.
omg that's huge
Well break it down.. not like there a thing else to do but to wait.
"Gwinnette is a process error, not likely to change anything just for your calculations"
He is awesome
Fetterman rules.
The fucking greatest!
Wait.. did something happen?  I step away for two fucking seconds..
but didnt the lead shrink again lol? what did I miss
"Listen, this is the most excitement we've had all year. Let us have this fear"
I spit out the drink in my mouth when he said this :D
This is very enlightening especially for folks that’re getting nervous. Thank you!
Thanks! The Pima County (Tucson) update made me pessimistic but this helps.
"If Biden gets PA and GA, Trump can get NV, AZ, and WI and it won't matter. Biden would still win."
"Very interesting, maybe I'm just dense, but how/where does he get this info from? This is good news to me, just curious where the info comes from!"
smash them up
Play guilty gear instead :)
Muh globalism... But also anime and Japanese video games.
Makes sense. That community has come out with some... Disturbing events decently.
Holy fuck!
Mark is getting the fuck off the sinking ship Lmao
He’s getting fired either way bc trump hates him
This is definitely verified. All over NBC.
I’ll never understand why. Just tell him no and force Trump to remove you.
My guess is call in the military to stop states from counting.
That’s not out of the ordinary
I mean probably just leaving a lame duck admin for a better oppertunity
Nothing. Every cabinet member does this for transitions of power.
"It’s been verified, confirmed on MSNBC maybe 30 min ago"
"*hey, uh, Espy.  Can you get your army guys to scale the wall and bring me McDonald's?*"
You have to wonder if he was demanded to shut down vote counting with federal officers.
Its normal
Confederate removal bill?
Read that it’s over renaming confederate military instillations
"He resigned to go back to being a lobbyist

"I'm with you, but the things he could say could set off a dangerous sequence of a events before 2021"
Meltdown AND THEN kick him off
"they cant do it until after hes out of office anyway, so youre fine. we'll have front seats."
They probably won't kick him until he's no longer president.
"Don't you worry, he won't be getting banned until Biden is actually inaugurated."
It's gonna be of eric cartman proportions
"my guess is if they kick him, it will be when he leaves office.

so he'll be on twitter till at least january"
Can we kick him off mid meltdown or will he launch nukes.
They wouldn't before inauguration but they absolutely should if he's no longer the president. He's poison.
Atlanta
"Yeah, the counties left are the more blue ones. Super close in GA. I'll bet on a recount. There's roughly 9,000 difference right now."
Both senate races are going into a runoff. Perdue is less than 50%
If you got the unreported count by using the reported % it could be off. Especially at this final stage. Or did NYT specify how many are left?
"> 69

nice"
One last plea to stop counting the votes or else we may have wide spread democracy on our hands...
"Yawn.  No one cares what you think Don,"
This won't be boring.
Oh this will be great
I'm sure it will be a measured and insightful presser.
"Jr just called for war. 

Gird your loins, boys"
Oh no

I’m so terrified that they are going to call their base to fight and riot.
But did you look at the dashboard?
"Even as a lifelong Pens fan, I approve this"

Nice reference.
"where? video, twitter, etc?"
They showed up everywhere. It's actually really impressive.
"... and it looks like they still lost.  Didn't show up enough, I guess."
Lots of those dems are blue collar. It's like the south. Lots of D that are old school
"Yes. Let's attack the only people that might have your back. 

My bet is GOP won't even want to take this to court and cut their loses"
Daddy’s going to prison 😢
Not sure what that means.
i don't get it
They've been much more reasonable than usual this week actually.  I'm shocked how quickly they dumped tRump
"""I hereby claim all remaining states.  So I win.  Sorry Joe."""
More complaining and yelling nonsense about “fraud” and “improper votes” I imagine. More of the same. Threaten some more lawsuits that will also get thrown out.
"Most likely scenario is he’ll just whine about the election being fraudulent.

Worst case scenario he attempts to send the national guard into PA to stop the vote."
Ob please tell me where I can watch this
"Outrage and to ask the supreme court to save him, with a topping of no evidence at all."
I imagine he only wants to speak because Biden spoke earlier.
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
"Say 👏 it 👏 with 👏me 👏

Clapping 👏 emoji 👏 sucks 👏 it 👏 just 👏 makes 👏 it 
👏 harder 👏 to 👏 read 👏 and 👏 it's 👏 never 👏been 👏funny 👏"
I thought Biden was a cyborg? Surely he's got another ten years in the tank with that going for him.
"... but the next in line is Kamala.  Th-that's not how it works, QAnon."
I wish the democrats were as bold as the q cult things they are
"Lmfao, subscribe"
"Lol that's not how it would work. Kamala and Nancy are next in line.

Unless obama took a cabinet position then sure he would be line."
Lol they must not understand the Constitution.
Trust the plan!
I knew that sneaky Kenyan would find a way to get power!
Yeah I'm up for it
"Not plausible... but, Thanks Obama!"
I think Biden is a good man but as a Progressive I would be more happy about a President Harris
Oh I can handle this one. Once Joe clone goes down they will give Obama a new skinsuit of Joe to wear.
My favorite Qanon theory was that JFK was going to rise from the dead to win the 2020 ballot
It doesn’t work that way though. I had a buddy say this at work to me today. I asked “do you know how  the 2 term limit works?” He said no. I walked away.
You've got to believe at this point that Q is two teenagers giggling as they think of the next dumb prediction to announce to their captive audience.
"Whoa, this is the most rational comment I've seen from a Republican all day. Congratulations!"
"Stay patient, we need folks like you to help talk sense into the ones who've gone off the edge"
Welcome to the Republican Party of the past 20yrs
"As opposed to the Iraq War lies, the myth of trickle down economics, etc?"
Your party is made up of a bunch of people who lack a reality-based belief system.
"Wait, you're saying Republicans were pushing conspiracy theories? Holy cow! Glad I was sitting down when I read that."
"Thanks, Obama!"
Oh shit I forgot
So was Hillary's husband.
"Actually, if Trump loses, he will be the first and only President thus far to have lost his reelection attempt."
"Sure, just need 3/4 of the senate, 3/4 of the house, and 3/4 of the states to agree! No sweat!"
"It is, that's why a lot of states have started to adopt the national popular vote interstate compact where, if enough states to constitute 270 electoral votes or more agree, they will all cast their electoral votes to the popular vote winner and nullify the electoral college"
i don't think you will get much argument from Americans if you tell us our system of government is completely forked

Sounds like something an abuser would say
"Lol. Nah. Once he’s in jail and his name carries the weight of Bozo in 10 years, he’ll just be another stain on an obsolete gop party.  It’s over."
"i honestly don't think they're wrong though. i'm not sure what the finer details of their point was, but considering how often Trump repeatedly ""said the quiet part out loud"" and retained his base?

The political landscape genuinely looks very different than it did ten years ago. Whether that was Trump's doing, or whether it would have happened regardless, who can say?"
I don't think it's completely outside the realm of possibility
"""you can't fire me I quit - but I can FIRE you all"" then he shows an M16."

going to a run off in January
"Ticking between 50%/49% pretty regularly. Still razor thin.

Just flipped down to 49.7% perdue"
"Will go to run-off, both below 50%"
Almost guaranteed to go to a run-off election in January at this point.
"Not great at the moment, but I remain hopeful for a run-off."
"He gave a quick speech about 30 minutes ago, it had a reassuring tone."
He’s no Robert that’s for sure
Did he ever go to jail for [battery against that female Breitbart  reporter](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/475827/) ? (I don't often agree with Ben Shapiro but to his credit he quit Breitbart over this (when they sided with Lewandowski against their own battered reporter) and then didn't vote for Trump in 2016.
"He did say ""Arbeit Macht Frei"" but in English."
I really hate that man
I really hate that man.
"Hope he gets a raise.this dude is a machine. I don’t even care that he repeats himself because, once again, every vote matters"
Actually DTJr said 2024 hopefuls weren’t being loyal enough and she immediately jumped at the chance to prove how loyal she was.
"Hedging all the bets for all the outcomes, this is the slimiest shit I’ve ever read"
Getting milked by the networks per usual
"I imagine it’s some rural county with a population of like 500.

Those extreme outliers tend to have very small populations."
It’s definitely nowhere you would’ve considered going in the first place
There's a county here in OK which got 92% near the panhandle.
I feel really bad for the blue votes in these counties. I think in some of them the Biden voters are in the single digits! It must be like living in a zombie movie.
Probbaly Holmes County in Florida
Exactly this
Indeed they have.
The whole day through
90K difference right now I think. Lowering possibly
counting
They're being counted. Specifically Philly County is being counted. Likely will be updated very soon
"\+90k for trump. with 430k still to count

biden needs 60+% from the remaining and is currently averaging 70+% over the latest drops"
Alleghany County is done counting. There's an upcoming press conference within the hour.
Creeping ever closer to sealing Trump's eventual twitter ban.
Biden in the lead by 67906 at this moment
"Come to WA! Prettier here anyway. And seasons. Real by God seasons. Outdoors, and on TV. You could have two."
How do they have other states?
Virginia is a southern state
Virginia: “why do you hate me?”
CNN
I'd say WaPo
I think the cnn.com stream is still free for election coverage
https://peacocktv.com is free (NBC)
He’s a legend
Money. We need to put millions into it to tie the senate
Based on the current totals I have my doubts either can be flipped. Hope I'm wrong though.
"If we can mobilize the vote similarly to how we did for the general, the chances are high. Trump not being on the ballot could further help the chances of flipping."
"Low from my understanding.  One of the runoffs was caused by votes being split between more than 2 candidates, so the republican votes thay went to a different republican candidate will go to the single republican candidate during the runoff, changing the balance of votes, if that makes sense?"
"Possible, but unlikely. Democratic turnout is usually lower in runoffs."
Low. Against Kelly the spoiler was another republican.
"if turnout is high, pretty solid."
"It’s possible, but tough. It will be a massive dem effort, the ad buys alone will be insane. Def the two most expensive senate races in history"
I'd give Dems a 20-25% chance. It's going to be a warzone.
"Puh. A lot of factors. What happens to the Democratic Party till the runoffs? Can Biden encourage people to vote once more and communicate how important it is? Will Republicans be so full of anger if their president loss that they vote to keep the senate, in masses, to hurt Biden?

We don’t know. The Democratic Party has to either inspire a lot more people there to vote or the Republicans have to lose motivation whilst the democrats vote."
"If Biden wins, not sure. Should be a disturbingly high turnout for a runoff since the senate is at stake"
There is going to be huge campaigns on both sides. The dems better push hard that mitch McConnell must be defeated.
"Relatively low. It depends a lot on Trump. Assuming trump loses, it’s unlikely (based on his character) he does anything to help the republican candidates in Georgia. Biden, Kamala, Obama, and Warnock will all be heavily campaigning down there, and trying to get as many people voting in suburbs and atlanta."
"I’m much more confident in PA flipping, I’m focused on Georgia"
"After four years of kicks to the balls, it's nice to have MULTIPLE paths to victory. This is a good feeling that I had forgotten."
"I think GA will fall short, but I’ll be happy if I’m wrong.

PA is just a matter of time. It’s taking so long *because* of the high volume of mail-ins from blue districts. It will only keep improving for Biden."
Por que no los dos
"GA.

Likely that GA will finish counting today... and if it's a Biden win, then Fox/AP will have to call the election for Biden (assuming they don't retract their call on Arizona)."
If Biden wins either it's over. GA will likely call theirs a lot sooner but PA is much larger and means Biden wins even if he loses every other state (which at this rate looks like he won't)
And Pennsylvania
"Seems like earliest NV will be called is tomorrow around 1200 est. They have Been saying should get calls on GA, PA, and more clarity on AZ tonight."
"Patience, young Jedi."
Yes
Yes if Biden gets PA that’s 273
"If Biden flips PA he can lose every single other uncalled state, including AZ and NV and still win."
Yes
Yes. Biden would be at 273
"Yeah, all Biden needs is PA and then nothing else matters."
If he gets PA he's at 273 so neither AZ or NV would matter.
"Yes, both AZ and NV would become irrelevant."
Yes
ARIZONA HAS BEEN CALLED FOR BIDEN. Jesus christ they called it for him on election night and he has a lead still. AP and fox both called it for him.
Yes. PA alone will do it.
No.
Yes
Yep
If Biden takes PA but loses AZ he’ll still need one of NV or GA.  Or NC I guess but I don’t really get the impression NC is still competitive
yes and yes
NV and AZ are unnecessary if PA is called.
"Yes, which is why Donald and his offspring are freaking out so much about PA in particular."
Yes
Only needs 61%
My GOAT
they're throwing everything to slow down the vote
Happy cake day
"He is LITERALLY calling for his father to start a war. Like, used the word “war.” I’m absolutely aghast...but I don’t know why I am."

Wasn't that Around the Horn? I though PTI was the one with Kornheiser and Wilbon?

"""Several hundred thousand ballots remaining"".

yessss"
Fuckin hottie with a body!
Michael Wallstreet and Irwin R. Sheister?
"Vot Etrump.

See, even gets the LEGAL immigrants votes!


But seriously, Cubans down there in Florida....what the fuck?  You know he would deport you if he had any legal grounds to do so."
Yes
"431,723 more to count. he needs 60%, he’s averaging 72%. I think we’re still on track."
"If the difference between the candidates is greater than the total number of remaining correction votes in Allegheney, they don't need to be counted."
It’s supposedly only like 40k I thought
Allegheny would be mostly blue votes.
"Allegheny has like 35k votes, Biden could win by as much as 200k"
If the rest of the vote brings it close enough they can give it to Biden since the vast majority of those votes are Democratic.
"Philly, suburbs, and pick-ups from smaller counties is enough to flip"
"I think once enough votes come in to give Biden the lead, then it will be called."
Depends on how big of a load either candidate has tonight.
"It's not all of Allegheny, just a chunk of mail in ballots that were originally misprinted. The vast majority of the state should (supposedly) be accounted for tonight."
Why are they being counted tommorow?
Not definitively. We made get a sense.
Nope
"If u think trump ever concedes u wrong

He will not concede on inaguration day

Nor any day after. He probably claims to continue to be prez tbh"
No and tomorrow isn’t clear either. Everything hinging on PA possibly reporting all numbers.
I doubt it. NYT said before there might be a decision on PA but no updates since.
He’d never concede. He’ll claim it was fraud or cheating until the bitter end
Hes going kicking and screaming
"There won’t be one. It’ll just be a month an a half of screaming fraud and unfairness until January comes and he gets escorted out of the White House, and he jumps on a plane and heads to Russia. 

That’s best case scenario. Worst case he tries to hold on anyway any means necessary, up to and including violence. 

I’m concerned to say the least."
I think you mean your brain feels smooth.
"Don't bet on it.  I don't think he'll do it.  If he did it will be one of those appearances where he is heavily sedated and won't show any genuine feels (like that ""locker room talk"" apology he did)."
"I do not doubt if he loses he will follow any standards of decorum or ever admit defeat. I imagine something along the lines of ""the never Trumpers are liars and demanding I leave. It's a shame. It's a shame. Could have kept America Great but they don't want that.""
He also would not be caught dead at an inauguration for anyone else. And would probably hold a pep rally for himself on that day just for shits and giggles."
Because sign language is meant to be very expressive! I took two years of ASL in high school and my teacher was actually deaf. He made the craziest faces ever. He’d be so into it sometimes that spit would be flying from his mouth.
Facial expression and body posture are essential to American Sign language not just the hands. It's basically grammar
"To actually answer, eyebrow expressions are used as punctuation in ASL, and raised eyebrows are for asking questions. :)"
Impersonating trump
That's because eyes have a lot to do with how sign language is read it is essentially the punctuation.
Not sure having Harris as the default choice for president in 2024 is the best idea.
"The plan is already there for her to take power, she called it a harris administration. Sleepy joe won't last"
Of course not
nope!
ofc... and he'll parade around that he still won despite the cheating. Just like the impeachment
Not at all. He claimed the last election was rigged right until he took the lead
"Yes, and then say they were still too popular to lose."
He did when he won in 2016
It's only fraud when you're losing
2016 election was going to be full of fraud until he won it
💯 yes. And there will be no persuading them
Yep. Still claimed fraud is the reason he lost the popular vote in 2016.
"Trump still claims there was fraud in the 2016 election he won, even after all the investigations he spun up ended up producing nothing. No reason to believe he would back down from his fraudulent fraud claims now."
Short answer: No.
"Trump still didn't accept the outcome of the last election that he fucking won.

He sure as fuck isn't going to accept this one."
Absolutely--all you have to do is revisit his conspiracy theories from 2016.
"They'll probably say something like: ""The Democrats tried to commit FRAUD!
Our BRAVE PATRIOTS stopped them!
This id a GREAT DAY for our country, the DEMOCRATS wanted to turns into Cuba or Venezuela! 
SAD!"""
"Dude he won in 2016 and still claimed that millions of illegals voted. So yes, yes is the answer"
Everyone is just waiting to cum
Exhausted is the right word.
I love it when he shrugs to show conversational unsureness
I think it's bc they are actually opening envelopes and what not. More manual labor than before.
It’s a close election so they’re making sure to get it right
No one wants to be the one to hand Biden the presidency and face the wrath of Trump
"All mail now. Takes a long time to open, organize, scan, cross-reference..."

I hope so. They got one.
"That’s an extremely good thread, thank you!"
Same! Haven’t slept much since election day. 😬
Lmao I have an 8am meeting tomorrow. I’ll still be drunk
What time is it there?
"I dunno where everybody is getting this idea Trump will run again.  For one I don't think the republicans would choose him again, secondly he's already old, and thirdly from what I've read he could be in jail within the next 4 years, or at least broke.  Plus they know there would be tons of votes already dead set on voting against him."
There's still time for him to defect.
43k
"43,404 ballots remaining in GA as of 25 mins. ago."
Thought they said 42k. Not sure though.
Hmmm. I feel the same with Trump...
They seem to be only count 100 votes a day...
Because then AP are Fox news would have to admit that they called AZ too early.
"They're like 45th in Education Quality by state. Give em time, they have a hard time counting."
"cause if they did, Fox new would have to say Biden won."
"If they call NV they have to essentially call the election, so they're probably waiting for absolute certainty."
They dont want to be demolished by a caravan of trump terrorists
They are being so shady with the counting and reporting. Basically they are just moving slow as fuck. At this rate they will still be counting by the time 2024 rolls around.
"Not enough information about outstanding ballots. In any other election year, it probably would have been. But Trump created a weird issue with how late ballots could be very different than early ballots."
"I have no idea, but can you imagine being the final state that calls the election for Biden, and what kind of shitstorm might occur?"
"Because it's a cluster fuck.

There are still a lot of ballots outstanding. NV sent ballots to all regestered voters. Some of those voted in person and some mailed it in. They do not know who received a ballot and then voted in person. Ballots still have some time to come in iirc."
"Plane to Russia, maybe."
Probably alone fuming with people who don't want to be there but have no choice.
"They haven’t had a public appearance since Election Day, so probably in his bed busy tweeting."
In the bunker
 On flight to Russia ✈️
Pence has hidden for the last four years.
"His team has been keeping him away from the camera.

By all accounts, he wants to be in front of one. They're handling him."
Pence is sucking his thumb on Mother's lap.
Pence is in Palm Springs
"Pence is crying to mother.

Trump is snorting Sudafed, binge eating McD's and KFC, and likely shitting himself while screaming at staff."
Packing their bags to flee the country before we can lock them up
i think the trump campaign staff is telling trump to stay off camera since they're afraid he'll say something stupid or incriminating which could harm their court cases.
I feel like I haven’t seen pence in a month. Is he in the hospital w covid??
Apparently he hasnt been seen in public for 48 hours and his last tweets were hours ago that got flagged by twitter. He's probably locked in his bunker yelling at his aids and asking Putin for asylum
He cryin’
"Trump? Nyet, my name is Donaldovitch Trumpkovskaya. Excuse me sir, I have a plane to catch. Hey mikahil, hurry up with the bags!"
What do you mean had he not been seen?
Sulking and raging at regular intervals. I imagine he's sitting in his room looking and smelling like a tandoori chicken that's been left out of the fridge for as long as he hasn't changed his underpants or put on shirt.
Either tonight or tomorrow or the next day or next week or next month or never. Take your pick at this point.
"Don’t be sorry! Thank you for caring about how our fucked up system works and rooting for us in this race! We don’t know when we’ll have more electoral votes in joe’s column for sure. GA was supposed to be done counting today which would have pushed Joe over the 270 line to a win if everything kept trending the way it has been, but they’re still counting votes in Chatham county. NV says they won’t have counting done till nov 12th but I personally think they’re waiting for another state to cinch the race for Biden before they report their numbers. PA could very well be in tonight but most likely it will be tomorrow. For up to date info you can google statements from the secretaries of the state in those states. Should give you the latest on projected end times for the count."
Soon ^TM
"Vote counts in the various states, which are how electoral votes are allocated, are slow to be tabulated.  Normally this wouldn't matter so much, but considering how down to the wire it's been, it's taking time."
I don't think he's capable of self-reflection
He thinks he's too clever for them to notice.
Yes
It’s going to be very close.
Yeah. It's likely Biden.
IMO no. Math doesn’t add up
"It's VERY close, but yes."
Yes. But I think that the final difference will be around 1000 votes.
"Your the third person I've seen say that, I'll have to check it out."
All of them.
Speculations over voter fraud. She shut it down real quick
Reporter asked her about tweets from 4 years ago before she was SoS where she said things against Trump.  She said she was a private citizen back then and took an oath to defend the Constitution of PA and the US and that is what happened.
"An asshole reporter brought up some tweets she made 4 years ago against GEOTUS. She responded by saying she was a private citizen back then and when she took office to this position she swore under oath to serve the state of PA honestly and uphold the results, or something to that effect."
She sounded great across the board.
MA does similar things for convenience like state police and state colleges
Listen here you little shit!
"State is a polity. The UK has Secretaries Of State for Health, etc."
1300
"Yup, Biden closed the gap by 500"
They are just being careful because you know trump’s broke ass would dine and dash on the bill for a recount.

"It's quite clear, and was held up in court twice. Those votes will be counted regardless of how much Trump screams about it."
"It is not. It says they must arrive by Nov 3. The state supreme court said that people who made a good faith effort to turn them in by November 3 should have their ballots counted, so people who postmarked it by then could still have them counted if they arrived up to 3 days late, because it's not their fault the mail was slow. The US SC declined to make a ruling on that, and let it stand prior to the election. However, the ballots being counted now, the 320k ish ballots do not include late arrivals."
It is
That’s what I thought? Is he mad that they don’t allow a lot of observers?

That happened to me earlier and I nearly puked.

"I picked up on that too.

Toomey: “There just hasn’t been the level of transparency as I hoped there’d be, and that’s very concerning to me.”

Jake: “Aside from the proximity concerns, which your Secretary of State has said she believes has been addressed, the president and his sons have made unfounded allegations regarding fraud and a rigged process. Would you say those are unfounded, or would you say you’re concerned about the integrity of the commonwealth’s election officials?”

Toomey: “(sigh) ... god damnit. No, no I’m not overly concerned.”"

honestly thought you were lying
Bigly victories coming! So much winning!
I love him so much
I love this guy
At any moment Biden takes the lead he's won it.  So its going to take some time
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
"No way, don’t have enough time, at best he’ll have cut the margin down to maybe 50-60K"
"He had a talk with Hannity.  Hannity said, look, I can get you an iron-clad prosecutorial immunity deal for you and family from Biden's team in exchange for your conceding the race now."
Depends on how self destructive the GOP is the next few months
at least we bought a couple of months to course correct and redouble GOTV efforts
I don't think so unless the Democratic party pursues a full-fledged campaign. The gap was too big.
"might be good for dems though.....

 trump losing might take the wind out of the ""red wave"" sails.."
Tf??? Lol no way
would not be surprised.
Fox is often an alternate reality.
Lol they are talking about whales.
Do they ever talk about the news?
"Mine too. It's his last chance. PA is about to flip and if the counts are in with Biden having a lead, storming the vote counts isn't going to matter."
"I would not be shocked at all if Trump comes out trying to call for some Executive order to stop the election or even try to declare martial law.   


(I don't think either will really happen...just saying if it did, I wouldn't be surprised)"
"Biden should do a few pushups on camera,just to watch Trump try"
"Biden is averaging 66.3%, needs to get 59% to clear."
More like 78k but still a whole lot smaller than earlier today.
"Hey not to be nitpicky but you are part of the universe, you have a sense of humor...therefore the universe has a sense of humor."

Pretty sure God has to bow to the power of math.

Jr already did that lol.
I read that he made many angry phone calls to Rep Governors
Eric Trump already tweeted almost those exact words lol
I feel like the only reason people know what happens in an electoral vote tie is because of that show
Shady?  Fuck the GOP Judiciary.  There's a damn LIVE FEED they can watch themselves.  How is that shady?  Morons.
"Generally speaking most politics in that area and NJ is pretty corrupt.

But this isn't a local issue, it's national."

Oh shit...
"That’s when I instantly GTFO of the water, and enjoy the last time I’ll ever see the beach..."
I have faith that he'll be able to do both at once
Definitely more likely that he’ll be inciting violence
I hope they interrupt his speech to call it.
He might have pissed off one too many Republican donor
Always next year
He can even be President there!
"If he can somehow get that to work in PA, maybe because of the late mail in ballots and flips AZ that would be a tie which he wins in"
"Biden is a career politician, people often seem to think hes some old fool that's just going to let Trump go or something. Trump is not getting off easy guaranteed, Biden is going to see that man in jail"
"Didnt he say something like ""i dont want to be here"""
"Trump also said he didn't really want to be there, so..."
Please don’t

My sources"
No regrats!
How did it go???
"I don't see it, what changed?"
How’s it looking?
And it doesn't look good but still plenty of cushion.
1% and Trump gained 5k roughly on Biden.... oof.
Excellent
Better than good. Erie county just flipped blue
Very good chance. 69% for Biden in a county that trump took in 2016
"still good. He just flipped Erie but 48 votes, and thats usually a strong indicator of the state"
"Very.  It's taking time, but the math bares it out."
Good
VERY good.
Excellent
I'd bet my whole next paycheck Biden picks it up
Very good it seems
Extremely good
*Very* good.
Very good. He has been constantly beating the precent he has needed to pass Trump all day
It's only a matter of time. It's a done deal.
That vote for Biden just now came from Trump counties. The big cities still have to report. I think Biden has this almost locked.
"The remaining votes to be counted last I checked: 370k

The cohort of those votes have split Biden 77%

If that percentage holds, Biden wins PA by over 100k votes

Biden can afford 10-12 points getting knocked off that 77% split and still win comfortably."
"Higher than my morning wood. Which isn't high, but higher than Trump's."
I was guessing 100k.
"He’s calling in the proud boys.  He’s been setting the stage to start stirring shit up, this’ll be his “we gotta get out there and do something to stop those democrats NOW!”"
implicit call to violence is my bet
He cannot cancel the election. He can try but a) it’s in the Constitution and b) it already happened.
You can place that bet in 2016.
You just need to know where to touch like John King: rubbing on the edges and once in awhile use the finger to circle the county for emphasis.
He's good with both
Yep lol that's him
I've met him in person...that is how he looks
"He's been up for days! He's basically defending the polling industry (he represents 538).

TBH, Biden looks exhausted as well! It's been a long couple of days..."
That's always my impression
"""You see, if you count only the republican votes, I've got 100% of all votes, therefore I win"""
"I understand the idea that his ego would rather “quit” than lose. But he’s trying to ensure his base doesn’t trust the system and I think conceding doesn’t line up with that. 


I wouldn’t be absolutely SHOCKED if he conceded but it’s the least likely possibility. I think it’s more likely Hes come out and declare civil war part 2 before he comes out to say he quit"
"Yeah, it doesn't help inform viewers to have someone just spin and lie all the time."
"I actually almost feel sorry for him hahaha, I think that's because he looks like Michael Scott from the office though"
Absolutely.
I read both CNN and Fox employ people from the opposite party to come in and get shat on.
Wiped*
Why wait?
Who is he?
Context?
Literally what it looks like haha
Or to stay awake
[deleted]
Do I even want to know?
Well he definitely has a blank Grindr profile.
He's always late.
I hate how bad these clowns make normal gun owners look.
only if they've been lying about the number of votes that still need to be counted
"I highly highly doubt it.

People are just scared of 2020 and don't want to celebrate, including me."
I don’t think so.
Don't tempt the wrath of the whatever from high atop the thing.
I'm a professional tranator. My professional opinion is that Santorum is a pretty shitty Trump translator.
"will be a double edged sword, there's no draw for people to vote out trump but there's also not trump drawing out the red vote. don't forget trump was able to draw out a lot of first time voters, too. not sure which will have a bigger effect"
I'm sure he's getting paid fat wedge
He thinks he's the GOP Buttiege
how much would you wanna get paid to do it?
He's probably in a contract.
Probably a good salary considering he has 8 kids
"Nah, he's just a whore for money. No matter who's paying him"
I think he's getting paid pretty good money to be there.
"Though they aren't equivalent, Juan Williams tries to argue reasonably on Fox. I'm glad he's there to push back but I wonder what it's all about sometimes."

Fox called it very early too.
"It's awfully fucking close man, and honestly they called too early.

Thank God they did, sustained me the last 48 hours but still."
"No. They base on many factors, it's not very cautious"
"hedging, the usual models aren't handling the number of absentees that well. If AP/Fox is wrong, they don't want to be wrong too"
APZ either knows something we dont even with that 98% vs 86% gaffe...or they're being stubborn as hell.
"Becuase they don't use AP they use they're own. AP is, at least up until now the gold standard for these things. It will be interesting to see what that AZ call did to their reputation. I personally think its safe Biden but it was too early to call it. If they were to to call it for Biden they should call NC or/and AK for Trump.

It was based on projections from mail in ballots."
"They are pretty much the gold standard, but this particular call is a controversial one."
What channel?
"As a G-fan, I am insulted. Godzilla is far more composed, elegant, and politically savvy. And has more realistic hair."

"On his way out he forms a commission to investigate the election, then in 2 years the investigation ends finding the trump's people fabricated 20 million red votes and we discover that ALL the states flipped blue. On that day, we let Nate Silver out of jail and say, ""oopsies!"""
Well that's quite in brand for him
"The classic enemy of fascists: strong and scary, but simultaneously weak and inferior"
And (so far) one Senate seat.
"Lmao only because of ""illegal votes"" just like how he won the 2016 Popular vote but for ""illegal votes"" and will win this election except for ""illegal votes.""

He isn't even trying to be creative."
Also might lose 2 in Georgia.
I'd say Junior but I have doubts that he can write.
It could be lots of i won but for the good of the US ill step aside...
"Agreed, I was just thinking the same thing.  Where is he going here?  This is very strange indeed"
So hard to tell. I dropped a saucepan earlier and it sounded about the same.
They just write it out like Charlie from Always Sunny.
I’d do it even if it meant I’d never worked as a reporter again.
"""Better the lie I want to believe, than the truth I do not"" is many people's motto."
It’s the end of American leadership in the world. As a Canadian it makes me really sad. But I don’t see how their standing can recover
"It's the promise of keeping the status quo, nothing else matters"
"Because he convinced a significant amount of his supporters that any news that counters what he says, or is bad for him, is *literally* ""fake,"" so as a result, when you ask, ""Well, what sources or who *do* you trust?"" I've heard many of his supporters actually say, ""Trump - he's the only one I trust.""

Obviously this is dangerous, and of course, people call it hysterical to compare it to past dictators, especially Hitler, but Hitler also characterized the press as the enemy of the people. 

At the same time, there's *some* truth to the concept of a heavily corporate-owned, profit-obsessed media might not be totally objective - most organizations rubber-stamped the Bush admin line on Iraq in the lead up to the war, which turned out to literally be lies, and I think CNN, for example, was gunning against Bernie Sanders - but *some* is an important qualifier, as they still do report straight-up facts, like COVID being *a real virus*, or that *votes have been counted after midnight on Election Day in every single US election in history*, etc., etc.  And it's not just huge, corporate-owned media they discount, but *all media* that goes counter to what they say, or just easily verifiable facts, like the content of the Trump tax bill, or what the ACA actually is, the level of CO2 in the atmosphere, that 5G can't create a respiratory virus. It's all ""fake"" if they don't like it."
Shit me too.  They are turning up all over!
"""The only reason he's gaining on me is that millions more people voted for him."""

No. He doesn't.

"It’s not a ‘comeback’, it’s just a narrative created by the order in which the votes are counted."
Should have counted the votes beforehand!
He bravely ran away
There's only one adjective there 😋
Wait what didn't the dems take the house?
"> And ""Georgia rigged the election for Biden"" (Both State Congress chambers are Republican controlled, the Governor is also Republican).

Republicans were also totally fine with allowing the Govenor of Georgia to run his own election while he was their secretary of state."
He's been exceeding that amount. Georgia is about to go Blue.
I haven't seen or heard anything from him since he decided to isolate after there was another outbreak of COVID in his staff.

"Was telling my girlfriend that by January her folks, diehard Trump voters, will claim they never agreed with him and he was a dumbass."

It's hard to believe that so many people could listen to him and believe a word he says. He is so obviously full of it. I don't get it.

He threatened to it in 2016 so yeah
Yes
"Yeah was thinking the same thing. Even if it's not Trump, I sense that the Republican party might shatter into two different parties."
he loves attention so yes
That would work in Democrats favor
The Democrat dream....
"he cant do this this year, starting his own party to threaten republicans might work to get someting from them but he wont win anything as 3rd party."
I was just thinking about this. It would kill the republican party so I think they would have to beg for his forgiveness and hope he comes back.
He's for sure gonna go 3rd party in 4 years
Well... He did run in 2000 as the Reform Party candidate.
Why? The repugnicans are perfectly happy riding his stupid wave of frenzied 'muricans. They would LOVE to run him again in 2024.

However many total submissions there are, they'll say ""We had X number of reports of fraud submitted"" and the narrative will be that's how much fraud there was.

It doesn't matter if you are insulting or include a rude picture. Odds are no one is even going to look at it. They only care about the total number.

Submitting anything is helping Eric Trump's fraud campaign look like it successfully found massive fraud."

No. Not til its over
Not for a bit.  It's 2020.
At least till 9pm eastern.
Not until Biden has taken over the lead

i thought it was fun. I knew nothing about it when i started it. I was put off by the explosions at first and was like this michael bay wannabe.....until i found out it was him and then just enjoyed it for its absurdity.
Forutnately it's a good song.

GA yes. PA says tomorrow morning but maybe might still be called especially if Biden keeps this linear momentum.
From what I'm hearing we won't know Savannah's results until tomorrow :(
PA won't be done till tomorrow but they said they might get to the point people could project it to tonight
Possibly
"No. I think GA will, PA won’t."

No
"PA is very unlikely, although there is an outside chance enough votes might come in to flip the state for Biden

GA, it seemed like they would finish by tonight earlier but things have slowed to a crawl.  I've heard that some important counties (Chatham in particular) will not finish until tomorrow."
"Neither will be 100% done but we might know enough to see who wins. If Biden takes the lead in PA, the networks will probably call it tonight and Biden can give his victory speech.

Georgia will be tough since it's going to be within a few thousand votes either way, and there's still 8,000 international ballots that could still arive"
"Pa its unlikely but we should have a pretty good indication of where it's going. I mean, we already do, but I'm hoping we'll see the scales tip before they wrap it up."
"Maybe not full results, but probably enough in PA to call it."
Remember when Brian Kemp ran for governor of Georgia while he was the secretary of state? I do.

"All I saw on google was ""Resignation letter is ready"""
"He has not officially resigned, but his resignation letter is at the ready."
Probably under pressure from trump to get military involved
The beginning of the mass exodus White House walkout. Could you even imagine what horrendous act they were asked to do which stimulated the resignation? I am guessing it had to do with napalm on domestic soil and dirty panty stealing.
"Earlier he called them ""spawn"" haha"
And the occasional 'spawn' makes me giddy
Was about to comment the same thing haha
It’s better than saying ‘fresh tendrils’ because that’s rude
Also I noted the relatively huge turnout and there were no violence during voting day.  I think that is good for this country.

Not certainly of course but chances seem to be increasing every update. I think it’s more likely than not now.
Not until it happens my dude
I want Biden to flip GA but I'm not going to believe it until I see it.
"Not safely, but pretty sure."
"Looking like it but won't give the outright victory (GA only gives 16 EC), so Biden gets only 269 total with GA."
Not until it actually happens
"The final margin will be under <5k votes in either direction, so nothing can be safely said about that. There is one somewhat populous Trump county still reporting too (Floyd) that could lower the percentage of incoming votes since Fulton and Dekalb are done."
"I wouldn't say ""certainly."" It's going to be very, very close. Well within the margin requiring a recount, either way."
Maybe

nice"

Sinclair Network has done so much damage to local communities. It would be good if a centrist house bought them out.
No but can tie with both runoff in GA
"Four should be the focus, of course, and there is about a three week margin between when the next session of congress begins and when the presidential term ends...that being said, if Biden-Harris win, then the amount of seats needed to gain control is only, really, three, because obviously a Dem VP means the Dems have the tiebreaker vote as of the beginning of the next administration."
"lol no he won't. his best chance is for the a senate special election with repubs failing to secure the Georgia senate seat. the dems would have to win both seats in January then, and Harris would break the tie. 

but that's putting hopes that Georgia will turn blue and its a stretch"
No way Alaska goes D
"They’re not gonna do shit. What could they do? Even if 1,000 of them got together and started killing people randomly the national guard would put that down.

There’s literally no way for that to happen- no way you’ll find hundreds of thousands of people willing to take up arms and kill the other half of the country.

I spent last night in a K-hole and this all became quite clear to me."
"My own gut tells me if Perdue gets a runoff with Ossof, Ossof has a solid shot, but it depends on Georgia's overall sentiment toward party majority in the senate. Also, my gut tells me Loeffler will, unfortunately, win Jan 5, because of the removal of the 3rd candidate (R) but I'd love to be wrong.

Edit: Perdue just dip under 50?"

Yes in some states.
Yes.

Yes

"Yes.
It means Perdue and Ossof rematch on January 5 with only them on the ballot as choices"
"If they don't get 50% or more at the end of this count, they basically get a do-over with only the top two candidates on the ballot."
"Yes, 50% or more."
In Georgia yes apparently
In the state of GA yes.
"yes, if you have one democrat and two republicans who split the vote the dem would 40 to 35 to 25 or something, which isn’t fair, so they do a runoff for the two highest below fifty. they should just use ranked choice voting instead and the votes of the candidates eliminated would move to second choice for each voter, but the outcome is the same just more work this way"

There were a lot more votes left in GA when Biden started chipping away at Trump's lead than there are now in NC. Not sure that it's feasible in NC.
"Could make some cash, its like 11 cents on predictit"
"Nah they are counting those now, but the number of ballots stops rising after the 12th."
Low
"Some guy on Rachel Maddow said they don't actually expect a lot of votes remaining in NC. I know sites may say there are ~250K ballots outstanding, but apparently a lot of them were surrendered for in-person voting and many of them aren't expected to be sent back.

In total they're only expecting ~35K-40K votes left in NC.

The Biden team said they have given up on NC and don't expect anything out of it."
pretty low chance. sucks cause we really needed the senate seat
Nah too far.
Could be. Not super promising.. but we won't know til the 12th
Extremely unlikely at this point.
"I mean they haven't called it, but at the same time the gap hasn't really changed at all."
probably too far. wouldnt know until the 12
That seems unlikely.
Bridge too far
Betting markets have it at about 10%
"They can receive mail-ins for days, so you don't even know how many there are. But I wouldn't put dollars on it."
PA and GA look better for Biden than expected and Arizona is still on the wire.
That’s what I’m saying
The guy in the back is a G
Yeah. Nevada won't finish counting until the weekend.
I’ve learned that counting in alaska starts really late
"Yes. Nevada is pretty much a done deal for Biden, he's now the likely favorite in GA and a heavy favorite in PA."
"Perdue just feel below 50% in GA, and biden is within 10k. Also Biden choose to within 100k in PA."
"Biden might steal GA, Biden should win PA easily"
Nevada sucks... But we already new that.
"Not really, other than NV is pretty incompetent."
"Yeah, updated vote results."
I learned in dark souls 1 the dark wood grain ring and thorns armor seem to have this weird interaction that sometimes stops you from rolling.
"Nope, not really.

PA is still counting, Biden continue to look on track to win  
GA is still counting, ITS GONNA BE FREAKING CLOSE  
NV is still doing FUCK ALL (I guess we learned they don't think they'll be done until Saturday or Sunday if you consider that something new)  
NC is still basically in holding pattern  
AZ I guess is kind of news, the race has gotten a lot tighter there, it looks like Biden will hold on, but not as comfortable in saying that as I would have been last night.

Other news for the day, the Trump campaign has rolled out their next strategy to steal the election by encouraging republican state legislatures to literally deny the will of the people and nominate republican electors even if the vote is for Biden."
"We learned that nothing went unexpectedly wrong for biden, which is pretty important, but no the expected situation hasn't changed much"
"I haven’t researched it, but apparently the remaining GA ballots are not from the Atlanta area. That reduces the odds of a flip. Hope I’m wrong."
"Have you ever seen Philly sports fans?

No wonder they're taking so long to count."
They’ve counted more in the past day or two than the entire population of NV lol
"[According to reporter Brendan Keefe, 40k outstanding ballots remain.](https://twitter.com/BrendanKeefe/status/1324477765035433984?s=20)"
43k
I think they said about 47k in a press conference earlier.
This
Bout tree fiddy
"At the most recent report it was 50,000 but that around 30 minutes ago (maybe longer). 

Edit: MSNBC just reported around 42k ballots still to count."
How many ever Biden needs to win
Now it's more of interstate doom posting
People just wanna doom. This shits been over for a while if you have faith in the math.
Always
"AZ is a mystery at this point, but PA and GA are very likely to go to Biden."
No one gives a shit about AZ and NV anymore. We need PA and it's fucking over.
Thats quite likely.
They added Gary Johnson and Stein voters.
I want to know this as well!!
The conspiracies are flowing through the right wing media farm at record pace
Everyone will have eyes on Trump Twitter as soon as it is declared. There is no way the social media event is gong to be over soon!
aww hahaha
It appears Nevada was not aware there was going to be an election
"Speaking for Pennsylvania, our legislature wouldn't allow us to be able to start counting mail ins until election day."
I wanna know too
PA was slower because they paused for the Trump lawsuit (that was diamissed)
"In PA Trump's team sued to make sure the ballots had to be counted after election day, quite a few I believe counted beforehand or weren't even close"
Lots of other states are taking as long. They just got called already because it was projected to be safe.
"You have to realize a lot of states are still counting, they're just not close, so no one cares."
"Very short version is that individual states are allowed to set their own rules for handling mail-ins, which means some states don't even begin counting ballots they've already received until after polls close."
"They aren't. All other states are still counting. Some are way behind. California 66% reporting. NY 78%, SD at 94% and like 5 people live in the whole state. 

Fact of the matter is all 50 states are still counting at least a small number of ballots, and the big population states have awhile to go. Just don't hear about them because they are already decided."
"Like the other comment said, other states aren't done either, but once one candidate is ahead by much more than the number of votes left to count, we stop needing to talk about them.

Like, it appears California has about 3,000,000 estimated votes to count, and they will count them, but biden is ahead by 4,000,000 votes.  Even if all the rest go Trump, which, yeah right... biden still wins it."
And a lot of states haven't finished either. These are just the only states that make a difference now.
The Republicans in those states wouldn't let the mail in votes be counted until election day. It was their plan all along to delay the count then call him invalid.
Most other large states are still counting as well.
"These ultra close ones are taking just as long as dozens of other states, but we don't care about those because they have already been called.  So basically, these particular states aren't taking longer than others, you're just only noticing with them."
Some had legislation passed by the GOP (lmao) to not be able to count until after in person ballots so it’s the GOPs fault really haha
"Some states allow you to start counting absentee ballots before election day, others don't. Also , pennsylvania gives their counters the night off. They stop counting. Michigan and wisconsin counted through the whole night. Pennsylvania also seems to have way more mail ins than other states."
All states are still counting. These are the only ones people are paying attention to because they're too close to call at the moment.
Atleast for PA they weren't allowed to start counting the mail in vote until after the in-person votes were counted. Or something like that
"They arent taking longer. All states are still counting. But if you have 95% of the vote in, and one candidate has a 60% lead, and you know what counties those last 5% to count are.. then you know the outcome.

So it's only the states where the margin is very thin that these final votes are the make or break."
Many of these states were not allowed to count mail in ballots until after the voting polls closed by Republicans.
"Each state has its own laws for how to handle mail-in ballots. Some allow them to be postmarked Nov 3, but arrive later. Some can't open any mail-in ballots until the in-person polls close."
"All those states are also counting. It’s just that with the number of votes left to count and the lead the respective candidate has the race is already called for that state. 

For example , NYT says CA has only 74% counted."
The rest is also still counting. But in those states its already clear who is gonna win
As mentioned by others it's not that these states are taking longer to count but longer to come to a clear decision. Texas for example has only counted 85% of votes but it's 'known' that the remainder of the votes won't be enough for Biden to catch Trump.
Other states are still counting as well but these states just don’t have a clear winner.
"Because they are close. Lots of other states are still counting ballots too, but their results won't change their states outcome. If Indiana (for example) were still counting votes then no one would care because trump easily won the state already."
PA wasn't allowed to start processing (let alone counting) mail-in ballots until Tuesday.
Some didnt start counting until the day of the election. Given this rule was put in place by the GOP of those states. Compared to most states got 2 weeks to count mail in votes so they can announce on election day.
John king is the GOAT
Fox for lawls right now
"Honestly I never used to watch them, but CNN has had some pretty good coverage. The magic wall is awesome"
Cnn
CNN because John King
John King
"Hands down Fox News.

Fox News is just, people having meltdowns, raging, and yelling at each other, and sounding sad.

&#x200B;

CNN is just 

BREAKING NEWS: We're still waiting on results, counting is under way.

BREAKING NEWS: YUP they're still counting."
i need it too
Let me know if you find out
Reddit threads
MSNBC hands-down
"For me it’s been CNN and John King hands down. He’s all data and facts, his knowledge is unparalleled, he gives so much context to everything. Even their “pundit” segments (where I suspect to give John an eating or rest break since he’s been on he’s feet talking for a week straight) seem less crazy talking heads."
"shockingly CNN, who i otherwise can't stand, seems to be have been giving the most focused, not pundit'y coverage."
"For just an electoral map to sit on your computer browser, the Fox News website is actually really good and their news in the last few days has been, surprisingly, relatively impartial."
Fox for the sweet melt down
Trust. Nobody trusts computers to do that. Nor should they. Software/Hardware can be hacked
Electronics can be hacked. I'm fine with people counting by hand and having a Dem and Rep agree on the results
Do you really want google to have that data too?
No to the safe part
Can’t hack paper ballots. I think it’s better tbh. Maybe your too young to remember all the diebold electronic voting scandals
"They're likely machine counted, it's just that the process to validate each ballot is time consuming.

They have to:

1. Get an envelope
2. Verify the signature and voter information on that envelope, meaning flipping through the book of registered voters or looking up the voter on a digital system.
3. Open the envelope and place the ballot into the pile ready to be machine processed.

It's not just the ballot counting slowing them down, it's verifying each voter and assuring that said vote will be properly cast.  That takes forever, which is why absentee counting is dragging on."
Because those are definitely the guys you want to hand the keys to the castle over to.
No resources were provided or policies changed to make that possible.
definitely but that would be too easy
"There are multiple reasons. 

But a big one is safety. 

Any automation is potentially susceptible to error or hacking. 

Mail in votes have envelopes that need opening. You need to see if the person folded it awkwardly or if they filled everything out correctly. 

And the perception of confidence in the count is just as important as the count being right.  This makes a hand, observable count preferable"
A lot of legislators are tech illiterates.
paper ballots are traceable and the process becomes much more transparent.
Do you know how much more crazy conspiracies there would be if that was the case?
"[https://xkcd.com/2030/](https://xkcd.com/2030/)

I actually do think they will now pass a COVID relief bill finally
"Remember, Mitch was the same obstructionist that said his #1 priority was making Obama a 1 term president. He was the epitome of obstructionist Republicans even before Trump.

Mitch has already indicated that if Biden win's he'd go back to nothin' but obstruction.

Can't wait to see how Trump will try to undermine democracy yet again.
He’s going to concede.
"Who's that guy speaking ? First time I watch Fox news, he look batshit crazy"
Yeah because obese old men fare very well in older age....made me laugh too.
"If it doesn't tip the election result, then it's not Florida. It's just a tight race."
"I mean, is asking someone to prove what they're asserting what counts for an 'ambush' these days?"

You’ll need another shower afterwards
The slow part or the fast part?
I'm with you.  The upper Midwest consistenly votes in large numbers.  My Trump supporting family in WI dragged everyone out as did my Biden leaning friends in Madison and Milwaukee.

Don't see GA flipping. Biden needs 76% of the remaining ballots.
"There were polls showing Biden flipping Texas, you were more skeptical of GA flipping than TX?"

Thanks for trying
"he told everyone that mail in was fraud, that by itself should have given a hint that he will contest those votes...."
And probably try to work to get mail in ballots thrown out in the courts.
They literally did it live on CNN following his speech.
Well by doing that he effectively segregated most of the Democratic ballots into one bucket that he could then at least slow down and eventually try to prevent from being counted.

"I mean seriously, AZ is a done fucking deal, there's no way it could flip now."
It's not for no reason - every dump we've had so far Trump has won just enough that if it kept up he'd win AZ.  There's reason to think that won't hold up but until it happens it's still in play.
You really think? I’m here and I’m sweating the shit out of it. All the Republican law makers just had a press conference and they all seem really confident they’re gonna take AZ.
"I mean, each dump of votes recently has Trump getting enough of a % to catch up and turn AZ red.  That's why lol."
"Yep. Biden's win overall is all but assured at this point, it's just a question of by how much. 

I reaaaallly want him to win GA, PA, NV, AND AZ - because then he has 306 electoral votes, the exact number that Trump had in 2016, and that will really bother Trump. Pitty he can't get just one more for 307 but meh, I'll take it."
"Too many worrying about NV, that's been a lock since Tuesday"
Can you blame us? Look what happened in Miami Dade. And so many close places. It's crazy the amount of Republican returns. Susan Collins and Lindsey Graham won. I trust nothing until that pen on paper is dry.
Imagine if she conceded too early. It would be amazing!!
What do they do about her conceding
She already conceded to Collins.
She already conceded though
What? Dude that race is and has been over for a long time
I believe Gideon has already conceded no?
Where the hell did you get this? AP says Collins is up by 70k with 99% reporting.
Wasn’t that race already called?
How realistic is that comeback?
Didn't Gideon already concede?
Am I missing something? Gideon conceded...
She already conceeded
Gideon already conceded
Gideon already conceded
[removed]
Oh. OH!!
Didn’t they call it? She conceded
"Gideon conceded already, although I’m not sure why she did so so early - ranked choice will give her a lot more votes than she has in the end and the race will end up a lot closer than it seems (but it only kicks in when the vote leader is under 50%, which Collins is close to now, and will probably go below as more votes are counted)."
Does a concession mean that it is over
Hmm.. a red mirage in Maine?
She already conceded right ?
What?? 99% of vote in?
"Your source is behind. AP has Collins at 412,238 and Gideon at 340,836, with 99% of the count in. Plus Gideon has already conceded that race."

If they're overconfident about the Senate that's good. Dems have a real chance to take it in the Georgia runoffs
This only works if the Democrats can figure out some way to get 50 votes in the Senate.

"If the senate stays red, they won’t approve any additional Supreme Court judges."
"Agreed, except they sort of can't do it with a GOP led Senate so they're not wrong"
Biden needs a democratic senate to add justices. That's not looking likely
He can't do that without the senate though
Can Biden pack the court if he loses the senate?
pretty sure Biden needs the senate to change the SC size?

"~2% of the vote would be just under 100,000 votes. Definitley possible."
Less than 10k with 40k to go means that Biden needs 62% of the remaining ones
Yeah I remember that lol
">I love sign language. It looks fake even if its legit.

Lol Thanks for coming to our aid Gandalf
Just assumed it would go to trump all my energy is on GA and PA
They won't count all their mail ins until at least tomorrow or the weekend
"NC is waiting until the 12th, when voting ends, but yes they will go trump/thom unfortunately"
Because they have stopped counting votes there until the 12th
"[https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-samuel-alito-amy-coney-barrett-north-carolina-elections-4cb4c214446bcfadbd73dafca9353701](https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-samuel-alito-amy-coney-barrett-north-carolina-elections-4cb4c214446bcfadbd73dafca9353701)  


"" Under the Supreme Court’s order, mailed ballots postmarked on or before  Election Day must be received by 5 p.m. on Nov. 12 in order to be  counted."""
"It is probably going to Trump, but because mail-in ballots can arrive as late as 5 p.m. on Nov. 12th, NC isn't doing much counting and therefore there is no new information to say ""that's it, now we call it"".   


If you look at   [https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html)  you will see that the only thing that has happened, is revising the # of remaining votes. With a difference at standstill there is obviously no *counting* reported."
"No station wants to give him more numbers in his column, bad optics"
"""Probably"" doesn't cut it for reputable news outlets, also it's extremely unlikely to matter anyway"
Counting til the 12th
"In rough numbers, Joe is down by 80k and there will be 160k+ that are likely heavily in his favor. He would need 66% to win North Carolina. It's seen as the least likely only because people aren't thinking about it. It's still very doable."
"They accept mail-ins until the 12th and USPS is holding a lot of ballots there. Very likely Trump and likely Tillis, but there is a chance."
because NC can still get mail in votes up to the 12th of nov.
It’s not certain. A lot of outstanding mail in votes in urban areas
Stopped counting votes until next week for some reason.
They're one of the ones who counts ballots mailed on election day received days later.
They’re done counting until next week when the mail in ballot deadline arrives. (Tuesday the 10th IIRC)
Raleigh votes which lean dem. But yeah they probably should call it.
I think they are accepting mail in ballots until the 12th and that is when they all get counted...the 12th/13th.
"Because it's still possible for it to flip, and there could be mail in ballots rolling in here for several days. Because other states are more pitched, will be clearly decided before NC, and will decide the election before NC's final count, NC is a little irrelevant now"
They can still accept votes for like another week
"Theyre counting and maybe waiting a few days between small batches of reports but they’re waiting until all absentee/military/post-marked ballots have been collected and counted until making a report on Nov12/13th. It’s incredibly unlikely the state flips but it will be a week before we would gain any insight anyway. With Biden at 264 and NV, AZ, GA, and PA on the cusp of finishing, by then it won’t matter which side they flip to if Biden doesn’t win any one of the above. And Alaska continues to not matter and will go Trump anyway."
Outstanding mail in ballots. As long as they were postmarked by election day they count. Those haven't all arrived yet.
They're not updating. I believe they said Nov. 12th at the earliest for further results.
"They won’t be done counting until Nov 12 because that’s the deadline for accepting ballots (as long as they were postmarked by Election Day), so everyone’s kind of forgotten about it. It would be awesome if it went for Biden too - it’s possible but probably not going to happen."
"Supposedly 150k of the votes remaining are from absentee college students so thought to lean left. Still, it's unlikely that Biden is going to get the 79% he needs of remaining votes to take the state, although I suppose the chance is high enough not to call it."
They can receive mail in ballots until the 12th.
It's not over in that state until 12 Nov.
"How about instead of resigning, he protects the democracy he swore to defend."
Where are you seeing this?
Didn't military leaders already state they didn't want to send troops in on the citizens of their country? Like a few weeks back? Or am I misremembering?
Would he not be better sticking around and stopping it
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
"""Proud Boys, stand to arms!"""
one of the most amazing things to me about this election has been hearing conservatives complaining about voter suppression
"i think its cause they want someone else to award biden the 270 win margin

they dont want the shit from trump and his legal team"
"They're mail-in ballots. They have to be opened by hand by two different people (the ballot is inside an unmarked envelope which is inside the regular envelope), then scanned in one at a time, then if any exceptions are found (the computer can't tell who the votes are for), the ballot has to be adjudicated by a panel of three people, a democrat, a republican, and a non-partizan, to determine voter intent.

It takes a while."
Ther website has been on 100% reported for the last 28 hours. But yet the votes keep rolling in
I think those percentages are just estimates.
"How long do you think it takes to eat the Trump votes to get rid of the evidence?? 

/s"
"Open mail, straighten out if creased or folded, scan it in, doesnt go in cause a fold on corner, rescan, goes in. 1 ballot."
They are exclusively mail in ballots which take forever for some reason
Probably hoping PA.hoes first so the civil war starts there
lol option three is one of those bet $1000 to win $2 type bets.
There's literally no way it's anything other than the third option.
Trump starts a civil war is more likely than Trump concedes.
"I can't watch, pls give me answer"
\#3
*sigh* I'm gonna go with C
What are the odds that before the 20th Trump resigns and Pence pardons him from federal crimes as Trump runs to an airport.
"1. Trump declares victory.  
2. Trump declares votes after x date/time are all invalid. 
3. Trump makes thinly veiled suggestion that people should do something about that."
I'm gonna go with option C sadly
"It's violence. Surround the polling places, make sure there's no fraud etc. Gonna try and get them to storm spots."
Obviously incites violence.
I pick number 3.
I'm gonna take the safe bet and say Donnie resigns so he can get a blanket pardon from Pence.
"I am kind of hoping for resignation.  I know it's a long shot, but it would just be a cherry on the sundae"
declares victory
* Trump says he wont stand down and the Markets tank
Obviously choice #3 is getting some serious odds
I'm betting on #1 but only because of the 1000:1 payout
Trump announces that there is a very important resin for him to take a trip to Moscow. Bigly important. No time to explain but trust me
"Now I know something about you!
You lost Arizona, now that's a blue state too!"
Bingo!
"Not the next update, but maybe 3-5."

"Kind of backwards.

States were free to allow slaves to vote. The fear that slave owners would control who they voted for (there were no secret elections back then) and thus if the President was elected by popular vote, then slave owners would have undue influence to choose the President."

"Damn, that loss will hang over Georgia's head for another 100 years."
"Biden will most likely win AZ, NV, PA. I think GA won't matter if it stays red eventually."
"As a GA sports fan, you never want your team leading in a big game. Tanking, it's our biggest export"
"That’s incorrect, Trump needs to win all four remaining states.

He won’t."
"If Senate goes to a double runoff and we are at 48-50, then seriously ..."
Why even bother?
“Why didnt they rig the senate?”
I responded by cutting mine out of my life.
Fake News
They rigged just the presidential election but not the Senate??
“You just can’t accept the fact that Joe is a duly elected President!”
Ignore them until reality sets in
Keep calm and demand evidence.
Tissues
"Oof say “this country needs to heal, just give him a chance, nothing ever changes anyways”"
Ask them to provide evidence of the rigging.
Give em the jerk off motion.
"If Democrats rigged the vote so well, why did we forget to expand the house majority or guarantee the Senate for us?"
"If you are trying to push back against conspiracy theories with family/friends remember that arguments of pure reason are more effective than arguments about lack of evidence. They don't care about evidence and they have been successfully convinced that the media would hide good evidence.  


Think ""do you really think all those people could be in on an operation and not slip up or say anything?"" and ""do you think 50,000 people are willing to risk conviction of a federal crime for the sake of one extra vote from a dead relative?"" over ""there is no evidence of widespread fraud"" and ""we knew more mail-in votes would be for Biden because Trump has been discouraging mail voting.""   


But also accept that it could be a lost cause."
Looking for the same answer
Laugh
Nothing. Just love them anyway
you just laugh at them
"""You lost, get over it. Like it or not, he's *OUR* President!"" Let them see how it tastes."
"Say, yes... I saw the Fed Court issues... Can't believe Biden still won when Trump tried to stop ballots from reaching precincts."
Ask them why we wouldn’t rig the house and senate too
Democrats must suck at rigging because we still didn't win the senate...
"""They went to the trouble of rigging it just to forget to rig the senate?"""
"Tell them you can literally watch Philly count votes online, it's right there for them lmao"
Tell them to show proof. Real proof
"""Maybe next time."""
Laugh at their meltdown
Probably nothing you can do. You can remind them that both parties have election monitors at counting locations.
"""I spent the past 35 years of my life studying infectious diseases, just so I could TRICK bikers and back-hoe Operators into wearing paper masks!"""
"Point out to them for it to have been rigged literally tens of thousands of poll workers, elected Republicans in multiple states, and reelection observers from the Trump campaign would have had to have been in on the conspiracy to rig the election."
Where's the evidence is what I would say.
"Tell them that they are not entirely wrong. Trump tried to rig it, but failed."
"Just say ""Thank god they/we pulled it off"""
“If you don’t LiKe our cOunTry you CAn JuST GEt oUt!”
"Tell them to start acting like adults and accept that he lost, blaming your disappointments  on made up shit is the behavior of a 5 year old."
"The burden of proof is on them, you can’t argue against a theoretical lie. Then when they provide ‘proof’ you dissect it for the falseness that it is"
Ask them why all the incumbent republicans won senate seats
"Just demand evidence and say that you wouldn't believe they personally committed a crime without evidence. Hunches, beliefs, and feelings aren't enough reason to make a criminal accusation. They're not enough to invalidate the winning of an election. Believing someone is a criminal without being able to present any evidence suggests that the accuser may be unreasonable.

There's really nothing more that you can do."
Emancipation papers
"Laugh.  

  

What everyone misses is these people thrive on rage and making other people angry.  They just want conflict.  Just openly laugh any time they bring it up.  ""Yeah, and I'm going to be pope!"" works well too."
Brilliant!
Don’t. Your safe in your house. There is a million other reasons to drink for what Trump has done over the past 4 years. Your doing great. Stop that thought right now
nah dog. stay dry. lll drink for you.

"You got this bro, maybe a nice ginger tea instaed"

Don't shoot until you see the red of their hats!
Dont do it.  Stay strong.

How about the NC guy? SecDef will get him out.

"Oh, it's always projection with him."
I mean that’s the cornerstone of the Trump playbook since forever.  Accuse and blame others for what I am actually doing right now
Too bad they didn't have multiple opportunities to pass some meaningful election security laws. There just made their voter suppression wasn't enough to win.

Them and AP have called Arizona but no one else has.
"AP and Fox called Arizona yesterday and apparently aren't backing down. Most other sources say it's leaning Biden but is too close to call right now. While lost of the ballots are mail in, AZ has been using mail ins for some time so in theory they won't be as blue as in some other states."
AP also has him at 264
AP has him at 264 too
"Nah they just turn into anti democrat. Same old shit as the Obama years.

Tbf Democrats did the same thing for Trump. But I would say he was deserving of the criticism"
A smarter Trump will fill the void.
"trump is not going to concede here, he will go to the courts and do evrything to stop biden. then he will make a news channel to rival fox news and then get elected back in 2024 at which point he dies of old age and we get a proper fascist VP that then solidifies power and the country descends into riots and civil unrest leading to a massive hurricane year destroying the south completely and the start of a civil war"
"Quick shift to the deficit, if I remember correctly."

It doesn't matter if you are insulting or include a rude picture. Odds are no one is even going to look at it. They only care about the total number.

I don't want to celebrate early but Biden's pretty much won
I’m edging hard but I think there will be a good ending
"What is .1% of the total vote casted, and is it possible that that many votes were miscounted? Maybe"
Yes he can under 1%
"Yeah, but Georgia recounts usually don't change things by more than a dozens votes, historically"
"Good question.  But recounts typically only end up changing less than 100 votes in either direction.  If he's shy of 50% by more than, say, 300 votes, it would be futile.  The time would be better spent preparing for the runoff campaign."
Only if the difference between the two candidates is less than 1%
I looked it up and by law if no candidate gets 50% it goes to a run off. no recount.
My Pillow Guy is planning to run for governor of MN.  Please hope and pray they pick him for VP on our behalf.
Even two years ago that would have been seen as an amazing outcome.

I was thinking this scene: https://youtu.be/A9Tw0exe0VM
"It will likely go to a runoff in January as they're under 50% support with more blue leaning votes to come in. Having said that, analysis I've read suggests Republicans will likely be more motivated to come out and vote in January to keep control of the senate. There's a chance that one or both spots might go blue, but it would favour Republicans in a very red state."
Very likely
"It’s almost certain at this point, unless most of the remaining ballots somehow go for Perdue"
"Considering it’s been trending towards, and recently surpassed, the cutoff for a runoff election it’s a pretty good chance it’ll end up that way."
"they have counted 93% but it will come down to the wire, what dont u understand"
a majority of the votes have been counted but its close enough that there still isn’t a mathematical way to rule either candidate out
"Outstanding uncounted ballots could mathematically be enough to change the result, even if it's unlikely that they would."
What's there to parse? It's too close to call until counting ends or one person gets a bigger lead.

Use this site, it scrapes the NYT's data: https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html"
GA 100K is way too high. More like 30-40k I think. but the margin is only 9k!!
"The 100,000 number from GA must be an old number. It is way smaller than that now. I think votes left to count in GA is closer to 40K"
It sounds like there are far less remaining to be counted (somewhere in the 40k range).  It's a bit ambiguous as to how many have been counted but not officially recorded yet.
GA looks outdated; Sterling had an update an hour or two ago saying there were 47k mail in ballots left to count
350k for PA absentee ballots still to be counted (approximately) from SOS briefing right now
How do you mean?
Humble pie
Something about Biden “finding” ballots in his Basement or some shit.
[deleted]
They’ve said tomorrow is the next update.
"I don't think anyone cares about Nevada anymore tbh, PA and GA are probably going to flip and if one of them does tonight it's over



But to answer your question, Nevada said they'll be done between Friday and Sunday"
"Personally I think that ones done, but the two senate seats in Georgia will both go to runoff so there’s that silver lining. Without Trump as a motivating factor those could break blue."
Longshot.
Here's hoping.
Imagine misspelling Tom as Thom and leaving it for the poor asshole’s entire life.
"The difference is smaller for Biden vs Trump, would probably need the state to flip for the Senate seat to flip"
"The gap there is bigger than Trump/Biden, I doubt it"
So this is a really big long shot. But mathematically it is possible. The bigger news is that both Georgia senator seats are going to run off most likely
Seems unlikely though not impossible imo. If only Cal could’ve kept his dick in his pants.
"Unlikely, the differential is too high. GA runoffs are the likelier scenario."
[deleted]
GA is a big maybe and PA is almost certainly Biden
Yes
PA yes. Georgia ???
Georgia has narrowed significantly and Perdue has dropped below 50 meaning a January runoff
NV counted 10 more ballots
"The Georgia gap is shrinking considerably (under 10k now), and the senate race there is looking like a runoff."
"Perdue at 49.9%, so second round looks likely"
I went poo......thrice.
this guy's facial expressions give me life
"Biden: As many arms as I have and then more.

Trump: As many arms as I have and then more.

¯\\_(ツ)_/¯"
At this rate we’ll be at thread 420 by the time Nevada finishes counting
"or maybe Trump resigning, Pence becoming POTUS 46, pardonning him, and Biden being 47"
In his second term he's still the 46th president. More likely that he steps down after a while to let Harris take over...?
what was in the tweet? i didnt catch it
Maybe 430k to report and 340k to count means that 90k have been counted but not reported? Would be my guess.
Been wondering that myself. Are provisionals the answer?  Or maybe votes that have been counted haven’t been reported yet.
Does the Github include in-person votes?
I think the github is going off earlier reports. There could be counted but not yet reported numbers as well
There are more than just mail ins to count.  They have provisional ballots and some in person left as well.
my guess is they have 340k left to count but 431k left to announce
"There has commonly been differences between uncounted ballots and unreported ballots, it’s likely that there are a good number of counted ballots yet to be reported."
"\> Consult state websites and officials for the most accurate and up-to-date figures.   


Alex is scraping API from NYT. The official has more updated numbers."
"It sounds like they've counted more than they've reported, which is good."
Provisional ballots I believe.
"Provisional ballots, military ballots, and a very small percentage of yet-uncounted day-of ballots"
PA website says 340k. Alex is probs behind
"Yes, yes and yes? 

For one thing, it’s absolutely horrifying to see those that came out in support of this fascists. I haven’t been able to comprehend the fact that conservatives that have always valued unnecessary formality, decorum and bureaucratic vain-ness are now praising this complete buffoon that has literally no filter in his brain. And shit I knew conservatives were greedy corporatists but I’d not accepted that resort to outright fascism. You must have heard the saying that when facing loss due to democracy, to hold power they would reject democracy, but I thought it was hyperbole. I was so wrong. The most dangerous problem today for the USA is not Covid-19, climate change, it’s this brainwashed cult. If Trump does lose, it’s only going to push them further into the abyss of their own (and of course FoxNews’) fabricated universe of insanity. I don’t think Biden is going to openly address this. If Biden wins its a temporary respite from defending this country from the madness that is the conservative hive-mind and their absolute lack of self-awareness is going to make them progressively deranged.

To address some of the other stuff you mentioned, i don’t think this will be a political suicide for Dems if they play their cards right, the vaccine may get released sometime next year, the following economic boom will be praised. We’re in an epic recession already, yes things may get worse, but after hitting that bottom, only way is up"
"We have containment and management of COVID-19 to look forward to, an end to the tariffs, firmer policy with China and Russia, and a rebuilding of our international standing. I honestly think that competent handling of the pandemic can win the Dems some support."
PA is guaranteed win....and well NV seems to have fallen asleep
Because Arizona is still in question and people would rather want PA since it would mean not worrying about what happens with AZ
My guess is that no one wants to call NV while AZ is still too close to call for some networks since that would put Biden at 270. So we are awaiting a bigger fish in GA or PA to push him safely over without potential for embarassment.
"Because if Biden wins Pennsylvania it’s game over, rest of the states be damned. And GA is extremely close, exciting, and would be historic if it went blue.

Plus PA and GA aren’t apparently laying around in a fucking coma like NV and AZ have been."
"For all intents and purposes the election is over, I think we all just want to see that 270 number and President Elect Joe Biden put up on the screen."
Arizona could flip back?
"Despite being called last night by Fox and Associated Press, Arizona is much closer than originally thought and Trump may pull out of win there. That’s why Nevada is not enough. Nevada and Arizona would do it or just Pennsylvania by itself would do it"
"Valid or not, there is concern that AZ flips to trump. So that would mean Biden must win either PA or GA (or both obviously)"
Yea we want this over and in a large fashion so PA and GA are hot topics. Its not over till its over.
AZ isn’t in the bag yet. Some sources called it too early and it’s not clear Biden is the winner.
"Biden wins PA...doens't matter what happens. Trump wins PA, focus turns to Nevada, Arizona and Georgia."
"No, because Arizona isn't sure yet. If Biden wins PA it's over, no matter the other states. That's why it's important. If he wins GA he's guaranteed 269 so that one's matters too"
"If we win NV, but it turns out (in an unprecedented moment) that AP called Arizona wrong, then Biden is back down to 859 votes. But if he picks up PA, then AZ doesn't matter anymore and he just needs to hold onto NV."
"AZ isn't a 100% lock, so NV wouldn't be enough in that case. PA or GA are security."
Run up the score. It ain’t over until the fat lady sings.
"At least one concern is that multiple state wins reduces the chance of any kind of Trump challenge in court, or any fuckery in general.

270 exactly could mean fuckery with a faithless elector. A one state win, maybe, maybe, maaaaybe could get challenged in court. If Biden finishes at 300+ (which is very likely), it is a commanding mandate that is very hard to debate."
"Seems Arizona is shaky. Trump is shady and has his lawyers all over the election. AG and Supreme Court are skewed to his favor. The more the election could lean towards Biden, the better."
"If PA gets called, Biden wins regardless of AZ and NV. It would just be a sigh of relief without having to wait for the other states to finish"
Not everyone is fully convinced about Arizona yet. Also people want to see a comfortable maragin in the electoral college instead of barely sqeaking it out.
"AZ was called prematurely, so no winning NV doesn’t give him the win"
"If Biden wins PA it doesn’t matter if he loses every other state , he wins."
"It's because people aren't sure that Biden will win AZ. If he loses AZ then NV isn't enough to win, but NV+GA are enough and just PA is enough, and it looks like PA is Biden's best chance."
Trump must win PA or he loses the election.
We’re happy with PA win so that we don’t need AZ and NV but the more Biden wins is knife deeper in Trump’s wound.
"No, because AZ isn't confirmed"
"AZ is looking like it could end up going red. The outlets that called it blue are sticking with it, so could be nothing."
"11k doesn't sound like a huge lead, and it's not being updated as frequently as GA is. It's also a huge benefit to just win as many states as possible to combat any illusion of fraud."
PA and GA take a faithless elector out of play
Arizona isn't certain
Because Pennsylvania is planning on completing their counting tonight (I think?).  And Nevada and AZ are dragging their feet.
"Yea, not Nevada is Bidens."
Biden only needs PA to win. The other states are small fry comparitively. It's looking to be a win by several 100K that cannot be contested.
The main reason is because Pennsylvania has actual information to report on. Not sure what Nevada is doing but it isn't reporting numbers.
Because we want them all
Because if Donald loses PA then it is all over for him. He has no path to victory without PA... which is why he and his offspring are freaking out so much about it.
"If Biden wins PA, he doesn't even need AZ. AZ is slightly sketchy still. I think people are interested in GA, cause it'd be pretty historic for them to go D.

If AZ turns, NV wouldn't be enough."
Dude was a massive dick. Acting like its our fault mfers can't count

Most of those are expected to be counted [today](https://www.ajc.com/politics/most-remaining-votes-to-be-counted-today-in-close-georgia-election/6T4GGH4SFZF4NIRU6FGW6Y73VM/), but at least one county ([Chatham](https://twitter.com/stphnfwlr/status/1324434507341115394?s=20), where [about 17,000 ballots](https://bit.ly/3oY9Mn2) are outstanding) says it will need until tomorrow. So whether we’ll get a projection here later today is murky, too."
"35k, 17 of which are in Chatham, the rest are surrounding Atlanta."
"yup, i just tried and it's down"
probably too close to call officially by anyone but as soon as biden gains the lead it's over imo
"Depends on if it comes down to Chatham. They've said they need until tomorrow to get it done. If Biden gets over Trump without more reports from Chatham, it'll be called."
"It's tough apparently GA mailed out 8k ballots to service men and women , if the margin is super tight those could play a huge factor"
GA will be tomorrow I think because of Chatham County

He can just re-use his speech from last time.
Answer to all three is vodka

All of them
"NV, PA 100% optimistic. 

GA and AZ 75% optimistic"
All. They're all a lock for Biden.
All of them.
All of them. Biden is going to win bigly.
"PA and NV look pretty in the bag, no?"
I’m optimistic about PA and NV because of the locations of the ballots that still need to be counted
"PA.  GA looks good if trend stays as far as ratio of Biden voters.  NV looks good, but count moving so slow it's hard to see a recent trend.  AZ seems like it could go trump, but again, very little progress to report.  I've already written off NC (and AK) as lost causes."
"SO, I am optimistic about all of them, but I really hope we get Georgia. GA is in the deep south and if we get Biden to flip it, we might still have a chance at the Senate if they elect both Dem candidates. 

I will lose my mind if we get GA, that would be so amazing."
They'd rather complain then have to stand up for something.

"I came from the future:

War. At home or abroad.
Refuse to leave office. Claim he has proof of voter fraud. Stoke tension. Start a micro civil war.
Further attacks on every demographic he has previously gone after. Quick republican leaning legislation
Start the new civil war for starters.
"I mean, the worst thing is that he could nuke everyone in the world a few times over..."

Around 86% I believe.
"You can't just ""challenge the election"", though, you have to have a specific legal case e.g. that late arriving ballots shouldn't be counted. There isn't really a case he can bring that would invalidate enough ballots."

"If Tump concedes, I owe my friend 50 dollars. I personally don't see this happening, unfortunately."
"Nah, reports were that they were trying to stop him from speaking."
I think he will in a week or two.  Once he gets his escape plan ready
Are you kidding? I just saw his campaign chairman railing about the counting being a kangaroo court. Not gonna happen
"Honestly he shouldn't while he's still ahead in enough states. He's losing this, but it remains a statistical reality, not an electoral one yet. There will be time for him to do the right thing yet. (He won't)."
"That would be a weird moment to concede anyway, even in a normal election between normal sensible adults. Trump is clearly not favored, to say the least; but there'd be no harm in waiting a bit more until it's truly 100% certain before conceding."
Anything to bring attention to him. He’s so needy

He loses legal protection. That's why he's fighting so hard.
"We could hope

Shit"
If thats the case then we get to see a live shoot down
"I mean, going into exile would be the dictator thing to do..."
Secret service can’t let a national security risk like that out of the country
Lol I'm sure that CNN will just go back to calling him Donald Trump
So is ours.
"Well, it's 630 now, so probably not gonna be on time."
A diet and some exercise might help that.
Hence was Esper resigned...
"That a solid bet.  Lawlessness he created himself and now has to ""fix"""
"All Live TV streams have a delay, anywhere from 4-10 secs."
"Every responsible media outlet would do this, so of course no media outlet will."
No one who believes his BS watches CNN tbh.
Got what the Lincoln Project wanted
"

Trump needs 65% of the remaining votes in AZ.

IMHO AZ is safe....

NV hasn't rallyed properly for Trump since Tuesday night. NV is safe...

GA has a strong possibility of flipping Blue especially in a recount... 

PA is too hard for me to call."

MSNBC went off immediately! But I have to hear this shit - so on CNN
"Going to be? He hasn't officially lost and he already is. Imagine how stupid he'd look if he managed to win? All that inciting of violating and stupid fucking comments to say ""Oh, well...I knew all along. I never believed any of it was fraud or rigged, I was just making interesting TV.

A pipe burst in the Atlanta voting location on election day. It delayed in-person voting for about an hour in the morning of the most blue region of Georgia
Hahaha I am here for it
"Lol that has been my continual thought while watching Trump ramble. I can't wait for them to get back to Santorum, since he said he would not support any claim that the election is being stolen."
"He did win Michigan, if you just remove all of the votes Biden received. Duh!"
Yes. So is our SoS and basically the entire election commission.
"yup, moron can't even get that right."
dont stop counting trump said not to allow ANYONE to stop the voters
Yep.
"Yes, they even had a live camera on it. He is making so much shit up"
"In those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on them."

On a scale from 1 to covfefe...how huge do you think it is?
I dont think so because of military ballots and a recount

I told someone else in this thread that election night (or week in this case) is pretty much the only time I watch Fox News.  Their election coverage is actually pretty good.
What is he saying???
"WHAT IS HAPPENING? I don’t have CNN, what is this Santorum fellow doing?"
He's a politician being a politician. Hes jumping off ship. Hopefully the republican base splits over this.
"As a medical professional and Dan Savage fan, I find the use of cathartic in reference to Santorum quite funny."
It was extraordinarily pathetic. Pitiful.
Can you summerize?
Floyd county (88%) is unsettling. Otherwise it looks good.
They're actually fucking stupid. The whole state and election is being run by Republicans.
"I don’t either, I think Yuma county will stick to trump and Maricopa will swing for Biden"
"Fuck it, lets get weird."
PA just went down to 53k
"CNN keeps getting new batches of votes in. Just had one of a bit over 10,000 in PA where 75% was for Biden."
yes
PA just updated. GA I'm not sure.. I guess they decided it's time for a commercial break!
"Yes Don the Con, that is what happens when you count votes. Results change."
Votes have been counted but the results of that count not reported yet maybe?
"In Canada it means votes have been received but not reported.

When they break a box it lowers the votes outstanding.

Then they count it and it becomes votes counted

Then they verify, and report as votes reported.

&#x200B;

Served as a counter for Elections Canada and its a strict process, usually takes 30-45 minutes for the process to go from Outstanding > Reported, largely due to verification process of the ballots associated riding (district in US) and residency location within it. At least for mail-ins that is, location based voting is basically instant following the count, because location verification is required before voting.

&#x200B;

Its similar in US regulations, not 100% but close enough."
PA gonna end it tonight!
NV and AZ were enjoying the attention too much. GA and PA gonna finish tonight and no one will care about them that's what they get.
"i think tomorrow seals it for NV.   not 100% finished, but if they get another 50k counted and things go biden's way it's going to be all but over"
NV and AZ doesnt want to get riots from either side im guessing...
You're straight trippin if you think that Biden is going to make it 2 full terms. If he finishes this next 4 years I'll be pleasantly surprised.
The networks are gun-shy and the ratings they’re getting don’t hurt.
"Hard to call PA for Biden when he is still officially losing. Trump supporters heads would explode.  I am calling it, we don't know until Saturday earliest, Sunday most likely."
Yeah that's literally going to be insane
Blhahaa no wonder they are red states
"I feel sorry for the people of GA, I'm happy that the election commercials are finally over. They've got months more of that shit incoming."
I’m going to try and donate as much to that campaign as possible
"Well they know if they lose the senate and Biden is able to implement whatever policies he wants, that after 4 years of living under Biden the American people might never vote republican again"
"Oh no!

Anyway."
When is he speaking?
It's the dems fault!!11! lol
What joke?
Why the fuck isnt he banned immediately? He is *legitimately* calling for war. He's not an elected official or anyone of importance besides being the son of the president. Why is he getting a pass?
What a loon he is. Totally delusional !
KPop stans need to hit it with Hollaback Gwen fancams. Or whatever they do.
"Donald Trump Jr would frequently piss himself in college, and I assume, does to this day.

Just because he is too weak to stand up to the man who abused him into being a bed wetter doesn't mean the rest of us are."
This should be flagged by Twitter as instigating violence.  This is unacceptable.
what a ridiculous little man
Even Tony Montana would tell Junior to take it easy on the coca!
"...but we'll kindly forget all about this supposed rampant election fraud if the votes are favorable toward Trump! Fraud only exists if it harms our case, obviously."
"Disturbing in encouraging ""total war"" but also the utter irony of Jr. making ""banana republic"" accusations. Haven't been able to find the tweet for myself, though. Deleted?

-Edit-
NVM found it."
This is getting ridiculous at this point.
"I thought the Democrats were the ones that were gonna be yelling, crying, and tearing up the streets? 


Oh how the turntables."
Someone call his dealer. He is out of coke and other drugs
"It's treason, then."
"I suggest he go ""total war"" with his bare hands. 

Both of them. Put the glass now, Donnie."
Can't we ban that entire clan from social media... would make the world so much nicer.
"Sounds good. Most if not all the fraud will be Republican votes anyways and ""lost"" Democratic ballots. So yeah let's clean it up."
"Dog whistles and xenophobia, neat!"
Terrifying
Can you link it?
"""Stop looking like a banana republic"" You're right, now go away."
Oh Lordy!
Losing their minds because they know all of the corruption about to be uncovered. Might spend a while in prison.

Every vote counts. Anybody who thinks differently isnt worthy of leading this country.
Yeah this will be where I'm freaking out.  Stay strong Philly and don't get bullied.
This is what's had me real stressed.
They won’t. Chill out.
Good luck halting the vote in an area where they're voting like 90% for Biden. That should turn out well.
What states has Trump Jr won?
They’re fearmongering. Ignore it.
Wow. Source?
Woah.
highly doubt that. no such suggestion of anything anywhere near that
"Jesus, what the fuck is this timeline? Shit just keeps getting weirder"
Links?
"He hasn't resigned yet, just preparing his resignation letter. Supposedly."
its typical for them to have undated ones if theyre going to lose
That’s kind of scary.
"I know other people are blowing it off, but just these tweets are alarming. If you’re a minority, you have a bigger target on your back because of tweets like those ^ Just because he’s not physically out starting a war, doesn’t mean their cult members won’t take this tweet seriously."
"Nope. The military will not act, and are not supposed to act on US soil unless it meets an exception. 

That said, it seems like the officers from Homeland security are in his pocket, as he ""deployed"" them during the Black lives matter protests.  I tend to think that Junior blows a lot of hot air to stir things up

I recall being just blown away that a sitting US President was saying our fellow American's  legally cast votes continuing to be counted was somehow fraudulent or stealing the election (except, of course, where it could help him - that *wasn't* stealing, lol), which is never how it's worked, goes counter to our democracy, and any democracy really."

can someone tell me how they determine when a new thread starts? is it by number of comments?

They're defrosting
And doesn’t even make sense bc it’s guaranteed red?? It’s not even a tight race
Can’t believe the media haven’t called it for Trump. Is it really that close that Biden could flip it?
Moose delivered ballots.
Haha good point. And that isn’t even a contentious one
"Alaska gets a pass, votes are delivered by dogsled"
They literally bring in the ballots by dog sled
"Win or not, no different"
I think they might be considering unstatehood.
"Let the sled dogs mushing to ballots to the ballot counter center have a rest, sheesh!"
Alaska's going to Trump regardless.  It always goes Red.  So no one pays attention to them.
They don’t even go here
"Fun quirk with Alaska voting infrastructure, we have to wait for first snowfall so the votes can be transported from the northern territories by dogsled"
The votes are being transported across the tundra by Balto the sled dog.
Why does anyone even care about Alaska though? It doesn't matter.

the electoral college representatives could not vote the way the state voted
Biden gets to 270 it’s over
Yes there is a catch. Faithless electors. Google it.
"Faithless electors voting for Trump ignoring the ballot results.

If that happens it will be a truly shitshow tho."
He wins
Yes
Wisconsin has to do a recount because of the margins...so maybe but HIGHLY unlikely.
No takesies backsies once he gets to 270.
270 is the magic number - over 50% threshold for electoral college votes
Whoever receives 270 votes from the  electoral college wins
He wins.
"Yes. Biden needs only 270, but some states haven't completely finished their counts and hypothetically results could swing."
Yes
270 is 270
"Recounts will happen, so it's not totally sealed. But if Biden gets over 270 it's basically guaranteed"
Faithless elector could swing it in that case
270 is a win.
"270 is the number you need to declare victory. Would take a legal challenge to undo that, or a faithless elector."
The only thing that could would be outside factors of the process like the legal Bautista bombs trumps team are trying to pull
270 is a win! (Not counting some unprecedented shady shit)
100%
"Electors can choose to not pledge to the person they were sent to represent. 

If that happens the senate would hand the presidency to Trump."
270 is a 100% win.
Yes 270 is a win
Tie is at 269 apiece so yes
"If he gets to 270, he wins yes."
"Yes, at 270 he wins no question. Only thing that could change that is if it is EXTREMELY close somewhere and a recount is performed and flips the state. Which is extremely unlikely (that Biden would hit 270 AND it is incredibly close in a state AND that the recount changes it enough to matter)."
"No, 270 is majority of electoral votes. Once this is reached it’s mathematical impossible for the other candidate to reach majority.

Edit to include some reading material should anyone need a reference.

[US government page](https://www.usa.gov/election)

Math? 

538 votes 

270 or more is majority 

If neither candidate reaches 270, then it goes to HOR. house chooses President, senate chooses VP."
"In theory faithless electors, but hopefully that doesnt happen."
Faithless electors are possible.
Trump runs crying to the Supreme Court like your little brother crying to your mother because you kept beating him in a video game
Regardless there will be recounts afterwards and possibly multiple legal battles because Trump thinks the only way he can lose is if democrats cheated
"270 wins its, but there is always the chance of a faithless elector making it a 269-269-1 result, sending it to the House of Representatives.

There, each state delegation gets a single vote."
If he were to get 270 and Trump gets 269 Biden would still be the winner. Only one can reach 270
"There kind of is a catch. The electors have to meet and vote as their state indicated based on the election results. Faithless electors do happen. Depending on how big the margin of victory is, it could be an issue if someone were to change their minds or not adhere to the results."
270 gets you declared winner. 270 electors in the electoral college voting for you makes you the winner.
270 and he wins. BUT none of the trackers you are watching are official.
Faithless elector only
"State assemblies decide who to send to the electoral college - so theoretically some republican state assemblies could send ""bad faith"" electors to vote against their state's popular vote. 

If that happens you can *definitely* Americans to take to the streets."
Faithless electors...
"It would be a statistical certainty, but we'd have to wait for every vote to be counted just to make sure"
"Technically, few states have laws requiring their votes for the electoral college to go to the winner... it is just tradition... for like 200 years. So in theory, you could get reds in Wisconsin, Michigan, etc. to vote for trump but I think that would cause so much chaos that blues in texas would vote for Biden and the whole thing would go to hell in a handbasket... but this is 2020."
Faithless electors could complicate things.
"Biden gets 270 means he's won, yes. Obviously that depends on what you said. CNN saying you ""won"" doesn't mean shit if some legal shenanigans are pulled weeks later, as nothing is official until each state certifies the vote."
270 and it's over
No 270 is more than half of 538 (total number of electors)
"He just needs 270 to win, but Trump is sure to demand recounts. If Biden can get more than 270 it will be harder to argue against him winning."
GOP has been trying to drum up some faithless elector crap but I dont see that working.
Yep. Electors still need to put in their votes which they can go against what the state won. Thats why we need every state we can get.
"As long as there is no electoral college fuckery, they would confirm Biden."
Faithless electors. Or court fuckery
Some states still allow faithless electors despite a recent SCOTUS ruling that they can't.
Only outright theft through a couple of unfaithful electors.
"Not entirely true, Biden is the winner at 270. But to completely avoid some level of bullshit in the courts he needs a few more states. It would be very difficult to litigate multiple states simultaneously unless the supreme court wants to compromise the entire democracy ... not totally impossible but very difficult."
"Once all the votes are in, if Biden has 270, he wins.  Other than courts, the only other way you can throw a wrench into this system is if there are faithless electors, the people assigned to the electoral college by state legislators, can and have in the past, went against the vote in their state."
270 means a Biden win but ya expect this to take a while
"Faithless electors, look it up"
Google: faithless electors.
"State legislatures attempting to send faithless electors to vote Republican and ignore their states vote. Georgia would be the main candidate for this, 
Given how corkscrew crooked Kemp is, so you want the margin of victory to not rely on that state."
He has to Yell Jumanji or it doesn't count.
"If he only gets 270, there is the unlikely but still possible chance a faithless elector could cause a tie, or 2 could throw the election, but with how polarized everything is, that's not very likely."
Faithless electors ?
"In theory some states kind of allow faithless electors which is ridiculous, but if an election was decided by faithless electors, I'm pretty sure there'd be more to worry about than just four more years of Trump."
"270 is what is needed to win. The *only* thing from there on would be what’s called an unfaithful elector choosing not to follow the results. Apparently there were 7 successful faithless electors, five for Hilary and two for Trump. That was the most ever in history as well."
270 is final if the calls are correct.
"If he gets 270, Trump cannot win.

He will bring it to the courts and want recounts of course. But at 270 it is over."
"Technically, you could have a faithless elector who could fuck things up."
Secretary of State said there are about 320k uncounted ballots left
"According to AP, 879K. PA says 350K without provisional ballots -  this was from 2 hrs ago"

dont want to put my phone number there tbh
"What is this supposed to be? Like they're going to walk in to court with a stack of these printed off that say ""I saw a guy say he was voting for Biden!"" or what? 🤣"
I feel bad for formstack right now
It's still controversing
What controversy? Sounds like counting is going smoothly. Trump brought litigation earlier in the day about allowing their poll watchers into the facility or closer (I forget) and that was struck down by the state Supreme Court.

My bet is he’s just going to talk about how great he is and how injured he has been by the dirty vote counters
Michael Scott wasn't a malignant narcissist.
Michael Scott has a soul and actually cares about the people who work for him.
"And, like Trump, he isn't even a real person."
He's also from Scranton PA
Micheal Scott is a likeable character. Dont compare him to the orange orangutan.
"Michael was dumb about a lot of things, but he had a natural flair for actual business dealings and genuine empathy for not only his own employees but for people in general. For better or worse, such as in Scott's Tots.

Suffice to say yes, he would have been far and away the better president."
That's my home county where I grew up. Nice to hear they flipped

"Bold of you to assume he will be on time, lol."
Put on the Acapulco shirt and grab the ether flag

Faithless electors won’t come out alive this year. We are very polarized
Now that's a fun question.  I have no idea but I'm replying to keep track.
"Dunno, but thats how a civil war would start"
I don't think faithless electors going for Trump will be an issue. You'd have to find a Democrat loyalist that really hates Biden *and* thinks Trump is a good alternative. I'm not sure there are any of those high enough on the list to be considered.
[https://www.fairvote.org/faithless\_elector\_state\_laws](https://www.fairvote.org/faithless_elector_state_laws)
Don’t know. That is why we want more than 270!
What are faithless electors?
I hope so. It has to be well beyond truly contestable recount numbers.
How big of a margin is that?
"Lol, not Biden getting GA?"
"🤞

I hope he has a clear win in multiple cases so there isn't some recount fuckery."
I am not entirely convinced that site has accurate info on remaining unreported ballots.
"I'm skeptical of that, but if true, it should be enough to call the state for Biden as I don't think Trump can make up 30,000 votes after the first count."
more like 7k from my calcs
"This is great, I was trying to scrape something like this together in Excel, their solution is much better"
Yeah the ability for one party to completely block and obstruct is completely fucked.
Its runoff on two seats baby you scared for us why?? Lol
"You can calm down. They actually have a history of working with one another. Also, what kind of relief do you want passed? What’s “relief” to you?"
There is still a decent chance that we will take the Senate.
Georgia is going to runoff election so the senate can still be Dem majority with 50 Dems 50 repubs and VP Harris as tie breaker. There will be a crazy amount of money poured into GA from both sides these following months.
"Absolutely, fuck him. I have no idea how viable it is, but technically Senate passes/approves laws, but the actual power of the purse belong to the House. When the House attempts to pass another relief bill, it's possible Joe could issue an executive order by declaring the pandemic a national emergency (which it certainly is), and use the House bill as basis for the relief itself."
"I hate McConnell so much. But to be fair to that turtle man, he did say he would work with Biden on certain, more centrist proposals."
It's like the only reason he's still breathing is because of his sheer will to fuck over America.
Right... let him have a trial. Then lock him up
Obviously trials come before locking him up. But it's also clear he's guilty
Lock him up in jail until he makes bail
A trial will result in a lock-up
And then lock him up. What’s your point?
"Them focusing on accuracy rather than speed is exactly what is delegitimizing Trump's bullshit claims. 

It's not even that they're slow, it's just that their close, **most** states aren't ""done"" yet."
">legitimizing and emboldening the conservative talking points.

No, they aren't."
I think you'll find other countries have their elections ran by independent federal commissions rather than leaving it to individual state laws. the USA should take note. Though Trump likely would have packed that commission with sycophants too.
"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11641  
They have until December 14th to count and certify the votes. Since it is a very close election, they're probably taking extra care to not mess anything up."
"Yes, very, and all because Trump is a piece of human garbage."
"They’d have to leave their basements, unlikely."
Yah next 2 months will be fucked
"Much like Trump, I think it is a lot of bluster. Having said that, there will be some right wing terrorism, but there has been that for a long time. The FBI has information they're sitting on as well."
Oh you mean like Jr just tweeted? https://i.imgur.com/p8EO7aB.jpg
Nope. Most of them are mealteam6 cosplayers.
I think we might be too exhausted and we’ve all had multiple days of coming to terms with either candidate winning.
I’m already seeing assholes post about storming the vote counting places
I honestly think that’s what is taking so long in  NV... I’m afraid they don’t want to be the state that lights the powder keg...
After seeing that crowd in AZ yesterday you bet I'm worried.
"Yes.  The III% Militia here in Georgia has effectively threatened to commit terrorism... So yeah, totally expecting some violence."
"Yes, very much. I was worried before, and even more so now."
"Conservatives say they’ll riot but never do, leftists actually follow through with it and riot"
"Yes. But the more people, the media, and Trump himself play it up, the more likely it is to happen."
That's why it's important for the left to be just as strapped as the right
"Yep, and he'll egg them on."
The majority of them are just army cosplayers
Very. I think the places where votes are being counted now are the scariest locations because his supporters are already there. It could be anywhere though. Facebook had to shut down a huge group because of talk of violence on there if Biden wins.
There are going to be mass riots either way. You are right to be concerned. This election is incredibly divisive
Out of the frying pan and in to the fire!
Biden - Pence will be 46
Stay home please 🤣
You should do that anyway. 😉
I second this. TripAdvisor or Expedia?

"They are whiny fascist supporters. They also assume that since they have no integrity, that no one else can either."

Something tells me they'd be happy to throw the key away after throwing him in his cell
The secret service is sick of his shit too. They’ll throw him in
"Yeah. Someone informed me he'd still get SS if he went to jail. It wouldn't be so bad if he went to real jail, they'd probably just need a single agent on site and take him out of rotation with the other inmates. However he'd probably go to camp cupcake where'd he need several agents on 24hr. I guess I'll just have to be happy if they take away his damn phone. Then we'd only have to deal with info dropped from his prison girlfriends that visit him. (I'm hoping Alex Jones will tire of schlepping to prison to interview him eventually)"
"1. being a Republican is a major scandal
2. speaking in coherent sentences is a big turn-off to Trump's core fanbase"
Doubt.
Hopefully the Democrats can counter with someone other than biden who can also speak in full coherent sentences lol.
Hitler’s already dead
That'll be the antichrist
I think he should wait until Friday night
Why?
"I think it might also depend on the states too. If he hits 270 with Georgia, maybe hold off on a full declaration due to probable recount. Even more so hold off and wait for PA if it’s FOX with AZ and GA before other outlets call AZ"
Stop! It's not healthy!
I was just there too. Yikes.
What are they saying? Are they panicking? Are they complaining about election fraud? Are they celebrating because they think they won?
"Like not much they can do about it besides vote angrily in future elections. Sure they can hypothetically break shit or even start going into violent militia territory, but votes are votes."
Can you report back to those of us not brave enough to enter?
First fucking day
They'll drop like flies when forced to do actual work instead of popping up on cable news.
"I hope it's like the last scene of Mr.Deeds, where theres like one or two decent people there who are allowed to stay but everyone else is out."
A lot of offices gonna have to be fumigated....
"Mail in ballots are great. 

Idiotic state laws that don’t let you count them before Election Day are the worst."
I’m glad we have them. We just need a system in place to start counting earlier. I voted a month ago here in PA but they weren’t allowed to start opening envelopes until 7am Tuesday.
We can blame DeJoy for that
"Man, the Democratic party pushed for better USPS funding and allowing states to count votes before election day. And now here we are with controversy around lost ballots, and waiting on a trickle of updates because places like PA, GA (13M and 11M population respectively) obviously can't handle a tsunami of mail-in votes.


I mean obviously this was always the plan for the GOP, but it's frustrating that it isn't being called out as much that all of this was easily preventable and they stonewalled."
That's a penis!
Haha the vote share is a dick
"Oh wow, that's pretty funny. Biden getting closer is good too, of course."
Wait a sec... DAT’S A PEKKA!!!
This is an Austin powers meme right
Nobody knows anymore
AZ in 3.5 hours. NV tomorrow. PA and GA randomly over time
"Nevada officials say they may not have the full results until Saturday or Sunday, preposterous as it may sound. 
Secretary of State for Penn said earlier that it is perfectly possible they'll have their results out by the end of today.
Arizona I think was won't be concluded until tomorrow from what I've understood."
I doubt it. Maybe by Friday. This is completely outrageous. I'm losing my patience and my mind. I feel like I could have done this in a day with a few buddies and a few pots of coffee. What the heck is talking so long!? Completely crazy. We really need to overhaul our entire elections process here. This is crazy. It's like we're stuck in the 1800's. /rant
"Most likely not, although it is *possible* that Biden overtakes Trump in PA tonight.  It seemed likely earlier, but the pace of counting has slowed a lot."
"Maybe, no, unsure"
"Nevada, no. Arizona maybe. Pennsylvania said they will be mostly done, but there will be some outstanding, so that comes down to the margins of victory."
"We won't find out tonight (at least not by our definition of tonight, fellow European). Go to sleep :) It's gonna take at least another day"
"Nevada not a chance, they said they probably wouldn't have the count until Sat or Sun. PA said possibly tonight. Really not sure about GA or AZ"
"If the states finish counting and it’s close, we won’t know for sure for a while. Military votes still need to be counted in GA I believe, and recounts will be likely in many states"
Not Nevada.
When they're counted
Yes
He only needs Georgia
Yes
yes
"Doesn’t even need Nevada.
If you count Arizona as called for him, as you probably should, he ONLY needs Nevada."
"He’d be the president, he only needs two of what’s still available. Or only PA."
Yes.
"He wins if he gets any of the states not officially called (except for Alaska, which he will not get anyway)"
Yes
Easily
Yes.
"Yes.

Or just Pennsylvania will secure the win."
Yes
Yes
He only needs one of the two on top of the states that have already been called
yes
Yes
Yes
Yes.
He only needs Nevada to win really but getting Georgia would just be a solid twist of the knife we all want.
Yes he only needs one of those
"If Biden gets anything at all that is left (other than Alaska), he will win."
"He wins with PA, or any other 2 states. GA alone will make it a tie, but that means he’ll probably lose in the tiebreaker."
"Yes, if he wins both GA and NV, it’s over."
he just needs nevada
"Biden can win with just PA, or any two of GA/NV/AZ"
Yes
Yes
Georgia *or* nevada if we're still assuming az is a shoe in.
He wins just if he gets NV. GA and PA will just be extra cushioning for faithless electors
The Presidency no matter what after that
Yes. Biden wins with any two states left (not including Alaska) or he wins with only Pennsylvania.
"if he gets AZ, NV and GA he will not need NC or PA 

&#x200B;

At this point though PA is looking more likely for him then GA,. GA would be gravy on top."
Yes. Georgia and Nevada puts him over even if Arizona is lost
Yes
"He only needs Nevada if he continues to hold Arizona. I'm not banking on Georgia, but he will very likely win PA"
"He wins and then some. He just needs NV + what’s been called for him (If AP/Fox is accurate about AZ which by all appearances they are). He literally just needs any one of the states not called for him yet (Except you, Alaska) while Trump needs ALL states not called for him yet (Again, except you Alaska)"
"With Arizona being called for biden, he just needs one, doesn’t matter which state it is. 

If others aren’t calling Arizona yet, then he needs a combination of any two, or just Pennsylvania"
"Depends on who you believe if Arizona is called or not. With that called for Biden, all you need is Nevada, which is probably definitely most likely Biden's."
"All he needs is Nevada, assuming Arizona holds."
"Right now, he just needs Nevada and Arizona to put him at 270.  If AZ flips to Trump, but Georgia flips to Biden, Biden would still win.  

&#x200B;

But if Biden takes PA (and it looks like he will) then it doesn't matter what the other three do."
"depending on if you're counting arizona (some have called it for Biden, some havent), he only needs nevada. If you're not counting Arizona yet, he only needs Pennsylvania, georgia, or arizona to be called for him, on top of nevada"
If he gets either.
"I think he’d win with just nevada, assuming arizona stands"
Depends if you count AZ as his...
"Nevada plus any of Arizona, Georgia or Pennsylvania (or North Carolina, though most unikely) would do it. Or Pennsylvania outright"
"Going by NBC's counter (253 Biden atm). Georgia and Nevada get him 22 votes, Pennsylvania gets him 20 votes or Arizona and Nevada gets him 17 votes. All enough to get him the 270 he needs."
"If AZ is his he only needs one of any state aside from Alaska. So Georgia, Nevada or PA would win it for him."
I'm more fond of number 3.  Dixie Kong and baby boi was an extremely fun duo.  But final fight against K rool in number 1 had an amazing track.
Hella
"Trust math. Biden needs 60% of the remaining vote and is getting 72% on average. That's a 12 point advantage. He can win PA.

GA is Biden has 69% and needs 60%

AZ is Trump needs 57% and has 58% that's a 1% difference."
100%
sounds like there is a 80k philly dump for Biden coming at some point
Very.
"Consensus is pretty confident. ~500k outstanding, mostly coming from Philly and its suburbs where the majority of mail-ins have favored Biden at > 60/40 margin... but closer to 80/20 in and around Philly"
"Why are you saying the 4th, not the 3rd?

The whole point is that they are postmarked by Election Day."
"I mean, what should be done is whatever the election rules of that state said before the election. Changing them by lawsuit after the election is crazy."
You mean the third
where is the disconnect between owning firearms and wanting regulations?
"I was raised rabidly conservative, when I realized how brainwashed I was after Trump one thing I didn’t change my stance on is firearms. Still totally believe in gun ownership and I voted completely blue."
I was never really against owning guns but never felt the need to own one. Definitely was thinking about purchasing after these past few years
I would consider owning a gun in a state that already has lax laws but I'm certainly not going to push for less gun control in the states that have enacted restrictions.
"No, but Democrats should give up on guns. Not a winning topic for them."
Big misconception is that dems are against gun ownership. Most dems support the right to own a gun but most dems (and Americans at I think about 70%) want stricter gun laws and regulations.
I'm a democrat that believes we need more gun control. I also own a gun and believe most law abiding people should do the same. Gun control isn't take all the guns away.
"I think it's touching a 3rd rail for Democrats.  Every time they go for it, they seem to fuck themselves over.   I think we'd have less gun violence in this country if we actually addressed economic issues.  


I'm torn:  someone who has an AR-15 with little verification can kill dozens of people, and I'm not gonna go up to a mass shooting survivor and scream at them about ""taking my guns"".   I certainly understand why they look at semi-auto rifles after their experiences and are like 'why the fuck is this legal?!""  


On the other hand, we have police departments that are increasingly infiltrated by white supremacists and ruthlessly fuck with minorities and protestors.  Whenever i've seen armed protests, the cops don't seem to be as trigger happy about shooting protestors in the face with rubber bullets.

Considering the rise of fascism in the United States, I'd much prefer the left be as well armed as the right, considering that I think even metropolitan police departments can't be relied on to protect their citizens. Ideally, I'd want to live in a country that strictly restricts gun rights to hunting purposes or target shooting, with open/conceal carry being highly discouraged, but I think we're all aware that the United States is not in ideal conditions.  


Just my 2 cents."
"I never wanted to take away people's guns, personally. What I really want is just stricter background checks to prevent mentally ill people and felons from getting their hands on military-grade weapons."
"Personal opinion, no state or media station wants to be the first to call it until everyone can all agree on it out of fear of what could happen. We already saw Trump supporters in Michigan and Arizona, and I think now in Pennsylvania."
"As much as we may want it, doing so when the other candidate is ahead is gonna feed into their narrative."
Why not DIO?

"She would be the youngest president by a fair margin. Let her work her way up, she has a lot of change to power in both the house and senate."
"Also, I would be willing to bet that the top brass respect Biden a lot more than they respect Trump."
I haven't been keeping up. What's a Doomer?
"This is correct.  I served for 20 years.  We military folks aren't quite as dumb as some on the left think (which hurts my feelings a bit as a progressive).  We do in fact realize the military is controlled by the civilian government which is in turn regulated by the constitution.  To tell the truth, it was hard to lead when Trump was president.  I had to have higher expectations of my Airmen than I had for our Commander in Chief."
The military won’t get involved in a US election.  Disputes are handled by congress and the courts.
"Even the most pessimistic doomer I've heard expects violence to start as militias and escelate from there, not that the military will just jump right in any time now."
Officers and higher brass hate Trump. And why shouldn’t they? Dude is constantly shitting on vets.

Mitt Romney - he’s been edging for that seat the last 4 years and would probably swing a lot of undecided voters with his vote to impeach
"Trump will try to run from Russia. Won’t work. 

My guess is Mittens Romney."
Romney maybe?
Trump already wants to run again in 2024
Me too and I'm a man
Looking like Georgia right now
Looks like Georgia
My bets on PA
Pittsburgh in PA (Allegheny) is shut down for the day and will have no reports until tomorrow. We're likely to see Georgia called first.
"Definitely not Nevada.
My guess is Georgia with approximately 43k votes left to count"
I say Georgia.
"Nevada probably, then PA... Georgia is going into recount territory, which means it won't be called by any media outlets"
PA GA NV that’s my guess on the order.
Welcome back!
You were able to sleep? Lucky.
Way to go out on a limb
Agreed and I said the exact same thing yesterday
Maybe 1am?
Just look at the $15 an hour vote in FL and all the weed legalization/drug decriminalization.... progressive policies are very popular but the messaging is fucked when it’s attached to a Dem’s name in contested areas
"People say this, but I think they can tell at this point that abandoning their progressive voters is suicide. The squad comprises the rising stars of the D party. McGrath, the right-wing Democrat we've ran against Mitch for years, keeps on losing and losing, and now the entire nation has seen her lose.

What I'm worried about is the GOP senate. That's gonna be dicey to navigate"
"What's insane is that progressive policies are wildly popular in North America, but, no one wants to be perceived as ""socialist"" because its like a forbidden word or some shit.

AOC is literally one of the most popular and recognized politicians in recent history, but still the dem leadership cow tows to fascists - worried they'll be perceived as ""socialists"".

Speaks volumes that dem leadership is seen hugging and cheering with Lindsey Graham but fails to actually support the Prog Squad"
In progressive districts.  The country isn’t as homogenous as you want us to think.

Many states have laws about when they can and cannot count votes - particularly PA not even beginning to count votes until the day after the election - and some states allow absentee ballots to arrive later than Election Day as long as they were mailed before it. 

It is frustrating to see the slowness though because I feel like it just further galvanizes the trump base."
Same. I was thinking it’s because it’s all eyes on these swing state ballots right now and both parties are being extremely picky about the process further delaying it.
I believe it’s because they have to match signatures and are double checking each vote. Every worker deserves a beer and a massage after this shit.

Man he probably hasn't seen sunlight in 4 days
It's so good.
"A second election basically, but only the top two finishers are allowed to run. It benefits whoever wins that election. Considering Georgia seems to be a coinflip state, it's hard to guess how it will turn out."
If you don’t get 50% of the vote it goes to the top two in a separate election. This time it looks to be helping the Dems because they will still have a chance to take 2 senate seats in a separate election where Trump isn’t on the ballot.
When neither candidate gets 50% in Georgia you have to have a run-off with no third parties. It typically benefits the GOP due to low turnout among dems in non presidential elections.
"When none of the candidates get 50% of the vote then it triggers a runoff. A runoff is a whole new election, we all go vote again, and the runoff in GA would be January 5th. Obviously you want you candidate to get past 50% and just win with no runoff needed. But it’s better to head to a runoff and try to win there than to lose the general election."
It essentially means it no one got over 50% so they hold a special election for the senate seat and people get to vote again. It’s a chance for Democrats to get the senate if they can win that race (though not likely)
Run-off occurs when neither candidate receives at least 50% of the total votes. Another election will take place in January. Dems might be motivated to show up if the two seats in FA determine control of the Senate. It tends to benefit the incumbent but every state is different and the fact that GA has the potential to flip Blue is promising for the run-offs.
"If no one receives 50% of the vote, the two candidates with the most votes have a runoff with just those 2. Someone will get more than 50%.

Republican turnout for runoffs tend to be higher than Democrats. But if GA's Senate seats will determine a Senate Majority (it would make it 50-50 and the VP breaks ties), enthusiasm will be high for everyone to get out and make it happen. In GA, we had a lot of votes siphoned off by third party in the Ossoff/Perdue race and by other Dem/Rep/Third Party candidates in the Warnock/Loeffler race so here's hoping!"
"Basically if no one secures a single majority (gets over 50%) then the top two or three (depending on the specific rules) run in another election. The idea being that the people who voted for the now eliminated candidates can pick one of the top two (or three) from the last round.

In some places they go directly to just the top two and basically one of them will get at least 50% + one vote and win it.

It counteracts the spoiler effect and makes sure no vote is wasted. The people who voted for an unpopular candidate get another chance to have an impact and get their say. 

This is much better than some guy getting the seat with 30% of the vote because the opposition vote was split between three other guys, but also allows several representatives from each party to run.

France uses runoff elections to pick presidents, which lets more than two parties have a chance."
Associated Press and Fox think its definitely Biden whereas other still think it's too tight. Frustrating.
NYT as well. They say that they do not have enough solid info regarding the amount of uncounted votes.
"CNN is much more of a focal point for right wing conspiracy theorist. If MSNBC or so gets it wrong, it's whatever. But if CNN gets it wrong, all hell breaks loose with FaKe neWs!"

It’s been getting worse every year. Hell even my local Target was putting out Christmas stuff 2 weeks before Halloween.
Asking the real questions
"Special elections are hard to game out, but Dems are never favored in Georgia. It'll take an effort."
"It really depends on turnout, I'd argue Democrats could actually win if they manage to get out the vote.

Seeing elections THIS close in a state usually allows people to feel like their vote matters. If Stacey Abrams works with the candidates they could get a 50-50 senate."
It's possible if Biden wins
I think Georgia will vote like hell after this shit
It's going to be interesting.  Non stop attack ads in GA for 2 straight months coming up.
"Usually runoffs are bad for Democrats in Georgia. But with control on the Senate on the line and Trump off the ballot, Democrats may be more energized to turn out than Republicans."
Without Trump on the ticket and a lot of attention? It's possible. With Trump on the ticket he was able to net 47%~ of the vote.
"Hard to say, truthfully. It depends how the DNC mobilizes and whether they can get voter enthusiasm for Ossoff."
With all the exposure. Decent id say. About as good as Biden’s chances in GA before the election.
"Bro, no one has any idea.  Anyone who pretends to is full of shit."
"On one hand, maybe having Biden take the white house and the Senate majority be in play, and especially Biden winning GA, could energize left-leaning voters in GA that their vote matters, a LOT, and get them to turn out.

On the other, I fear a lot will be content with ousting Trump and stay home.

It's up to the DNC to really pound the messaging that the fight isn't over and keep turnout high. 

Based on the POTUS election though, obviously the possibility is there."

"Schitts creek (but the first few episodes are nit as good as like episode 6 onward). The good place! I don’t know if this is lighthearted but the Michael Jordan/bulls documentary on Hulu was amazing (I’m not even a basketball person). There’s a cute movie with Rachel Leigh cook and damon wayans jr on Netflix. For a while, community was on Hulu- not sure if it still is."
I'm in the UK watching 'Bureau of magical things'. I think it probably fits the bill! Not sure it's available where you are.
‘I’m not okay with this’ on Netflix
That Karate kid sequel show... laughably unrealistic.
I think yes.  Biden by around 4000.
PA SOS not competent..
A lot. Several hundred thousand.
Also curious
All of them are mail ins but not sure how many
Couple hundred thousand or so
[deleted]
https://www.votespa.com/About-Elections/Pages/Counting-Dashboard.aspx
326k according to cnn
"About 326k.

Today, Biden has been getting 78% of the mail-in ballots.

He needs something in the mid-60%'s of the rest, I think."
About tree-fiddy
"PA- Biden 48.7 Trump 50.1 Trump leads by 90,000 now, 326,000 votes left to count"
"Still Trump, but the walls are closing in on him. He's up 90K and theres about that much in Philly alone where Biden is getting roughly 90% of the mail in vote.

Factor in that Biden is winning the mail in vote in every single other county, and the math becomes nearly impossible for Trump"
"If GA flips and gets called for Biden, then we will find out today."
48k
Approximately 50k I believe
I wanna say like 40k but I might be misremembering an earlier comment
some one said about 43k left
Bit over 40k
40k - 50k
Say what now?
Source?
"The way Georgia has managed to count roughly 10,000 of 50,000 remaining ballots in 24 hours I reckon those guys could push it into next week"
What's the website?
"Don't you worry, he's ""alive and well""!"
hmm...very suspicious
USSS used tranq dart number 3 just to give themselves frickin' five minutes to *think.*
the one proving trump is wrong or the guy claiming that 6 feet is 25 feet
Holy shit yes
As opposed to?
You’ll graduate before they stop dragging ass
You can count on me to vote against Johnson
They were in 2016 too - and we failed then. Not trying to be negative. Higher hopes for flipping toomey’s seat tho.
Oh I'd love to boot Toomey out in 2022. The Dems could run a corpse against him and I'd still vote Democrat.
She said something negative about Trump.4 years ago when she wasn't SoS
When she was a private citizen she tweeted something critical of Trump. It was a non-issue. She still handled it like a champ.
"She said that the title ""president"" in front of Trump's name demeaned the office of the presidency. But that was years ago before she took an oath as a goverment official. As she said"
"Yeah, we rigged it by letting people vote and counting the votes."
"He seems to be the only reasonable person in the room - I had to look him up after watching this and yes, hes a Democrat"
It’s just a shit show tbh
He doesnt have the balance lol
"appreciate = value

not like... we value it as complete and utter shit. He's changing no one's minds."
he has the hunger that only hands can satisfy
Don't ever forget that Van Jones was secretly working with Kushner and Trump behind the scenes.
aren't they all?
He seems reasonable
Is that eastern? I don't want to miss it.
"""Agitating"" huh? Hmmmm, could be a show!"
He’s got South Hamptons face
wait 40 minutes for trump to vomit his sayings
No
Maybe he's gonna concede.
"It’s a clear violation of the Hatch Act but 1) Trump doesn’t know that, and 2) even if he knew he wouldn’t give a fuck."
Is he speaking then?
He's live at 6:30? What time zone?
Where can you see the total number left to count?
That’d work out to Biden winning if the votes split ~63% in favor of Biden. Hasn’t he been doing much better than that?
"No doubt Trump will talk about the ""biggest fraud in US history"" despite there being absolutely no evidence supporting any fraud. He can't handle losing because of his weak and fragile ego."
Where can we see this
Im holding you to this
I cannot wait!
"For a third time? Yeah, probably."
...again
Lol he already did yesterday morning
He declared victory on election night lol
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
"Maybe he and Alex Jones can partake on ""Make America Great Again (Revisited)""."
yep!
Yes
Just dropped to 78k votes
"Yes, down to 78k now with around 400k votes left to count"
yes
Yes
It’s at 78k now so yeah
difference down to 78k with ~395k votes to go
Yes.
Yes. Down to 90k now with about 300k remaining.
Yes
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
He already declared himself the winner
maybe he'll concede!
"Probably. That and accuse the other side of stealing the election. Maybe give his Proud Boys the go ahead. 

I don't put anything past him."
"Uh... he already did that at 2:30am Wednesday. He literally declared himself the winner. And guess what, nothing happened, because he has zero power to declare the election winner."
Probably
Krayt Dragon strategy?
"What if... what if he concedes... that would blow my fuckin mind. I know it's gonna be some lying ass bullshit but wouldn't it be great if he was like... I've done what I came to do, I exposed every weakness in America. You're welcome."
It was a red county
"More than sufficient. He needs 59.9% from here on out in PA to win.

[https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html)"
I think that percentage is really on the edge of where it needs to be. I also dont know what district those votes came from because the only 2 that are big enough would be philly and allegheny. So maybe that was some districts added together?
Law in PA doesnt let them count mailed ballots early
"Some states count absentee way before the election, some states had to wait until after polls close. Them be the rules."
If it matters next week I'm done with this shithole country
"Yeah, especially because postmarked ballots. Not only does mail in go blue this year because Trump telling his supporters not to absentee, but I wouldn't be surprised dems dropping it off 5 minutes before USPS closed on election day."
He should start campaigning again. All his zombies can watch him for 4 years if they want.

At that rate Biden could possibly win with a 100k lead.

I'm using Fox News sadly but they do update the vote count pretty quickly.

[https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html)
I just Google searched official election results
nytimes and usatoday
just google
https://results.decisiondeskhq.com/
Foxnews / Google AP - are the same and update often.
https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html
"I like NY Times. Shows percent lead, vote difference, and % of votes counted. You can also click on a state and scroll down to see the counties and a good breakdown (percent lead, % counted, and # of votes cast/absentee)."
i like politico.com
"They're going to get bitten by AZ and they know it, so they're very reluctant to call any others.  Plus they are doubly reluctant to make a call that would be tantamount to announcing that Biden wins overall."
I was just about to ask about that after seeing that Republican Senator being interviewed on CNN. So not enough votes to make a difference?
what about the moment he comes out dressed like some jojo villain
Marine helmet?
I'll wait for the autotuned supercut
"Unless you are a Nielsen household (and you would knownit), you watching doesn't give them ratings."
How are ratings collected in the US?
Is that fully up to date? If so this looks like it is very close to be no roads out for Trump at all.
Any reason provisional ballots should split differently ?
In what state?
Which state?
"Where do you see that number? I'm following the NYTimes scraper, but I guess we know NYTimes have been slow."
Give him the gold damnit
Nice
it’s technically possible if both democrats in georgia win their runoff races
"The senate majority will likely be decided in January with a double runoff election in Georgia so maybe, but not likely."
Going to need to sweep the Georgia runoffs just to tie it looks like.
"Yes, double runoff in Georgia could get Dems to 50 seats"
Yes. Most likely two runoff elections in GA
"Yes, with a double runoff in Georgia.

That would be wild though, January's going to be a battlefield."
*Barely*  Gonna depend on the runoff elections in GA in January.
"Yes, with Georgia going into a runoff election in January."
"Kind of. One runoff in Georgia, with another one possible."
Yes. Potential two run offs in GA in Jan for parity (VP casting vote). Slim margins but something.
Yes
Hanging by a thread.
"I don't think there's a chance this election directly, but IIRC both Georgia senate seats have fallen into runoff territory. So if they can be swapped in January it would be a 50/50 split and the tiebreak goes to the VP."
down to the run offs that will happen in GA and republicans are favored in those. The senate is still technically in play but it's not likely that democrats will win the senate
Tie possible I think with runoff stuff I dont understand.
"perdue dropped under 50%. If it holds there'll be two runoff elections in January. If dems take both + kamala they take the senate.

It's a long shot but not impossible"
That would be a nice change for them
Have they called AZ yet?
Yep. The question is whether Fox will call it first. That would be delicious.
Bidens camp knew he would do this too. Probably because whatever the hell trump is about to say it will just end up putting him in an even more bad light.
I mean...he's already doing that but maybe he'll actually say it out loud.
"Nah, he still needs to stay relatively civil because of all the lawsuits."
He's sunbathing in his terrarium right now and cannot be reached.
Hes said they should count all the votes
He said basically the votes will decide
I think he said to count all the votes
Basically said If Biden wins he's gonna block basically of his cabinet choices.
"He's talking about how to obstruct if Biden wins.  Because, of course he is."
He's in favor of counting all votes and very willing to dump Trump
"He wanted Trump to lose and only cares about the senate, so he doesn't care. There's a reason he's completely shifted gears on COVID relief: because he knows it'll help Perdue and Loefler for the run-offs."
Honestly they will shock me. I know I shouldn't be shocked at this point by anything he says but that would be wild.
Yeahhhh that will never happen unfortunately
All the news channels should have it on YouTube
You can watch CNN live for free online - they'll show it.
livenewsnow com has 3 biggest stations.
"Yeah. YouTube. Just search for nbc, cnn, fox, whichever. You’ll find an official stream most likely. :)"
Probably any YouTube news livestream
CNN.com
CBSN or Nbc news on youtube
"NBC news on youtube probably. If you have a vpn, you can download the CNN app and watch it there."
Probably on his Twitter page like the other day.
Chances are this speech is top level cringe
"Huge voter fraud, really just beautiful it is tremendous the powerful voter fraud goin - by the way I have done more for democracy than even the founder fathers. I'm told they would say you've done so much for the people, why don't they like you? You know what I'd say? They are evil the dems have been brainwashed and aren't even Americans. Id say they are tremendously evil and I'm told they would agree with me."
I'm dressing as Kornacki next year for Halloween. Just need some brown pants.
By Sudafed you mean meth.
One thing we can be sure of - he'll be coked to the gills
You're just noticing that now?
Stop my balls already hurt.
I imagine he's going to call for militias to attack polling locations. Just my guess.
I just appointed a beautiful SCOTUS justice and payback is imminent.
"Trump holds a political position in office, and therefore they can't shut his account down for all of the false information he's spreading. They will probably do it after he loses though :)"
Boarding up. Like every Main Street USA
what's dave's line?
"I'm out of the loop, what's the line?"
"Yes, in fact I'd say he's slightly favored"
Yes
95% chance Biden.
"Yeah, slight edge for both in hundred regions probably"
Nate Cohn expects it to flip then go to a recount
Yee
Let's just say that Biden will be have some authentic country grits for breakfast.
Yup
He ain't conceding. He's gonna whine and complain and spout conspiracy theories for his base to cling to.
[removed]
6:30 but there’s absolutely no way he conceded. Prepare for a tantrum about vote counting
It would be the shock of 2020.
"He'll never admit defeat. He'll probably try to cancel the election or make an implicit call to violence. It's at 6:30PM EST, yeah."
That’s what I’m wondering like 15 mins?!
"hell no, lol. He will whine though"
"> hopefully one admitting defeat

We all know he's not capable of doing that..."
"Correct, in 13 mins"
Yes
"There is a zero percent chance he will admit defeat, and not just tonight, at all."
It’s in 15 mins if that helps
"Trump has never conceded anything willfully in his life, he isn't about to start now."
Zero chance he concedes.
Yes so 5:30 central
No way he concedes even after Biden is sworn in.
"Yeah actually, bit its a waste of time"
"In all honesty, if his cabinet had any balls, it's time for the 25th"
Oh absolutely. It's like 8 to 10 hours in absolutely nothing
"Blue country drop is later, a few hours I think"
No info about that but the results could be consistent with Mohave County plus a mail-in ballot advantage for Biden that abates the final Republican percentage.
"Yes, there's still a bunch of votes in the Tucson area and I don't think we've been giving a timeline for when those are coming."
"the urban districts always take much longer, usually many many more ballots. Half the population of Nevada lives in the county around Las Vegas"
Source?
[deleted]
"Two scenarios - they didn't expect these last batches of mail-ins to heavily favor Trump, or what someone said about the earlier part of the last batches favoring Trump but the later parts will favor Biden by Democrat/Independent registrations is true. I can't really see how AP/Fox would know about the second scenario tbh, but we'll just have to wait and see."
"Don't quote me, but my understanding is that the majority of remaining votes are in Maricopa county, which went 51-47 for Biden. They haven't been releasing those all day. Even with a narrowing lead, once it's down to Maricopa, Biden should win."
"People with knowledge of how Arizona elections normally go tend to think that the most recent batch of ballots come from a particularly heavy Republican learning part of the populace, something about people who drop off mail-in ballots on election day. The rest of the ballots come from either provisional or people who mailed in but arrived closer to election day, those are supposed to skew more blue. That's what people are saying but I can't confirm."
"Personally I think they called it because they forgot that AZ Republicans generally votes by mail, and now they are too embarrassed to reverse it...

BUT, there seems to be some consensus that while the late arriving mail ins skew red, [the *late* late mail ins are independents which seem to skew blue](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1324219729595289601?s=20)."
"I think they both called it when arizona had accidentally reported 95 or something % in. But that was an error and it went back to 80%.

So thats why it looked so early. But then they looked at what was out and said eh, ok. Lets just keep it instead of retracting. 

If it werent going to slow it wouldnt be an issue. But arizona has to go slow so that we think there are still glaciers in the world."
You cannot be serious.
Not confirmed but highly likely
I don’t think it’s official in either case until all the votes are counted but it’s looking good for two runoff races here.
"Warnock is for sure a runoff. Ossoff is in run off territory just barely, but it’ll go to a runoff if the remaining ballots trend blue or are pretty much a tie between the parties."
"Not ""confirmed"", but ..."
What happens in 14 mins?
Rick Santorum.
Look up Santorum on urban dictionary. That’ll tell you all you need to know about the guy. He’s *that* bad.
Look up Dan Savages take on Santorum...
Rick Sansscrotum
He has always been a party over country kind of guy.
PA seemed reasonably certain earlier that it would be tonight. Not sure now.
there is a chance PA. might be called tonight.
PA continues to update. Same GA.  Possibility they call it tonight.
"Not GA, but probably PA tonight for a call."

I’ll never understand why they keep Santorum on. He’s always been insufferable.
It's not difficult when what you say makes no logical sense.
It's called a dirty santorum. Look it up and you'll thank me later.
He doesn't deserve Converse
Oh absolutely. The tears will be delicious.
Is he wearing converse lmao
yea wtf? does he think hes on ESPN right now?
cnn just said trumps son called his voters to go to war.  did that really happen?
Yes.
you should be worried if he loses too.
No shit.  Dems are all about riots and burning shit down....crybabies
We don't like the most powerful elected official in the world being a raving lunatic
I can't stand Trumps face and tweets so I want to be there live when Biden wins.
The outcome of the election determines whether or not I move to the states.

I'm also a night owl so I've always followed US sports and other live events so I have something to watch at 1am-2am.

And lastly, the car-crash shit-show of it all that you can't look away from."
"My sincere love for this country despite the world scale bullshit it can create sometimes.

My attachment to the ideals that helped create this nation from the ground up.

The fact that despite it being flawed, it's so far the only democratic superpower of 330 million people that has been able to thrive in whole human history, proving to the world that this tremendous achievement is possible and needs to be cherished.

The fact that I learned English by myself to better understand this country and communicate with its citizens.


All of what's happening right now is very important to me, and I'll be proud to see this nation overcome any of those tremendous attempts to destabilize it in its very core."

Environmental policy. Incredulity that someone like Trump could be even elected once. Hope for change for a less bleak future for all.
"Like it or not, the US is a major world leader and their political moves have ramifications for our country - most recently Trump's election was part of the rise of global right-wing nationalism (all across Europe, Japan, India, Brazil, Philippines etc.), and also helped to legitimise that kind of loud-mouthed, lack-witted, right-wing politics that elected Johnson in my country."

Even if he tried the states wouldn't listen.
He can't do that.

OK so it was only everyone south of lower makefield that's the cause of this result, but still."

The base is what it is. They know that. They don't have another Trump in the party. He has the secret sauce that incites the base. Theyre willing to scuttle the country to try to keep him up there because even they aren't quite sure why it's working so well with the right.

I guess I shouldn't tell you that we're over in #51 now then.
They’re scared of the meltdown
"Part of it is probably not wanting to give more fuel to conspiracy theorists on the right. Trump is already claiming the media was complicit in ""stealing"" the election, imagine what it could be spun if media outlets started calling these states before they tally is done"
"I think that's part of WHY.

They called other states too early and ended up eating crow."
"I'm at work so not following super closely, could you briefly explain why??"
Tell them they suck harder than Kirby.
This was already disputed. This was an issue with data entry
there's no point in talking to them.
Under 11k left in state. They have until tomorrow to count military and overseas votes. So if not tonight tomorrow afternoon.
"Those ballots aren't only military, but expats, and civil servants. They have trended dem in the past few cycles. Also, military polling by military publications showed the president's support dropping bigly."
you cant call it for biden because you're assuming that the vote ratio will be fixed for biden's advantage until the last ballot and no one has the authority to make that call because its pretty much only happened this year...

Arizona is releasing another batch tonight.
AZ pretty much only reports once at 6pm MST every day. Nevada been drunk this whole election.
I think AZ is going to announce some more tonight.
They want PA to decide it I think.
"I think they stopped for the day, at least NV"
"Arizona's gonna have another vote dump coming at 9 PM eastern.

Nevada is taking a frustrating amount of time, but the vast majority of the results left are in Clark County, which is going to break democratic. Jon Ralston said earlier today that he ""does not see a path for the President"" in this state."
Arizona will report tonight. Nevada who the the fuck knows at this point.

"Go for it, then you can move to Alabama or Florida"
"Go for it! I've low-key slipped a finger in my cuz's cooch while she was sleeping and I tasted it, videotaped it, and splunked baby batter in her beige-stained underwear right in the gusset. It was the biggest throb my urethra has ever gave in my life."

orange was ejected
Obviously only one option. Stop the Count here....but not there.
Would prefer to never see Trumps number increase...
"Weren't we relying on the gap constantly closing?

If he holds ground at all, that means we're running out of time to catch up, right?"
This would mean Trump Pence wins unfortunately
That also favors republicans. The fact that they couldn't even give a nod to the popular vote in a tied electoral college is crazy.
"That's exactly what they're implying. They're the minority, therefore, somebody cheated. That's all it is to them."
It's a lie. There are Republican and Democratic observers both ensuring a fair voting process.
"My guess is Trump isn't happy with local Republican party observers and wants people working for and loyal to the national campaign that will just lie about what they ""saw""."
Not at all.
No
Biden is winning mail ins all across Penn. at about 70+% even in red counties.
There's way more than 80k votes left in PA
"They could recount 50 times before Georgia and Nevada count 50,000 votes."
None of the three have even completed their initial counts
Where is PA analysis?
Killer Mike made this happen.
Thanks
Lol love it.
"curl -s in lieu of --no-progress-meter for me, but thank you. Also 10s intervals because the suspense is killing me lol"
can you show me how to run that?
"That's awesome. What does the ""Change"" column indicate? How much the lead has changed since the last pull? How many votes have last been reported?"
yeah
Yeah I think so.
"On Fox news and AP yes, on every other news outlet he would still need 1 more state"
"Yes, if Biden wins PA or GA, he is the presumptive victor"
yes. actually not sure. he has to win georgia and one of the 2 states hes in the lead in. AZ or NV. depends what map your looking at
"Trump needs them all, so it’s an L for trump"
"Technically no, if biden wins GA and trump's wins every other state, Biden will lose.

But if Biden wins GA and NV, he will even without AZ iirc. Hes looking very favored to win NV"
Yes.
"If AP or Fox call GA, they call the election. Anyone else calls it, I think it can still tie if Trump wins Nevada (unlikely)"
Yup.
"No, since trump can win without GA if he keeps those other three."
"Trump can still win if he gets PA, NV, AZ and NC. Biden still needs one other state, but it'd be like 99% chance he'd win if GA flips."
if trump wins NV and AZ then he doesn’t need Georgia just PA and NC as wel
"If Biden loses all remaining except GA, it would be a tie. And he would lose due to the current rules of tiebreakers."
"Normally, yes. With Trump, no. Most candidates will concede when it comes down to a situation like that, aware that there isn't another route for them. Trump will fight and challenge and sue as long as he is able to."
That would only get Biden to 269
"No,  Biden needs PA by itself to win or 2 of the other states."
Yes. Either GA or PA gives Biden the win
"No

There are 5 states left assuming Alaska goes Trump (it will)

Biden needs PA or any two other states to win.

If Trump won NV AZ PA and NC he would win without GA."
No if Trump took everything else he would win
GA alone (not counting AZ or NV) puts him at 269. He needs at least one more state.
"biden won't win with just georgia, but there is like a 99% chance he's going to get nevada,"
"If Biden wins Georgia but loses Nevada/Arizona/Pennsylvania/North Carolina then Trump wins.

If Biden wins Georgia and Nevada but loses the rest, it's a tie (and the House would award the election to Trump)"
"Trump can still win without GA. If Biden were to only win GA, he’d be at 269 which leads to a tie where Trump is chosen President by the next House."
"If Biden wins any state, he's at or over 270 and wins."
Worst case scenario would be a 269-269 tie.
"No, if Biden wins GA, and Trump wins everything else, the result is 269 for Biden and 270 for Trump."
"Trump would also need to win PA, NV and AZ (all 3) to win."
"No. King was wrong there if that's who you are watching. Trump doesn't need GA to win. He would need all the other uncalled states though if he lost GA.

If Biden won GA he would have 169 confirmed electoral college votes."
"No, if trump wins those other ones, it could end in a tie. At which point the house, with one vote per state, chooses who to elect."
Yeah probably.
"Georgia only with everything else going Trump would be a tie I believe. AZ + NV, GA + NV, AZ + GA or PA alone for Biden gets it for him. Trump has a very narrow window where he can win and Biden has several routes, looking quite good IMO."
"If Biden won GA right now, ignoring the states you mentioned, he would be 1 electoral vote short at 269.  
  
If that was the case, and Trump won everything else (NV, AZ, PA) it would be a tie at 269.  
  
In the event of a tie, the House - which is Blue - votes and their final vote decides who will be President."
But what about the military votes in ga. Someone told me that could mess it up. Is that accurate?
Tell that to the fails in senate and house
306 isnt really a landslide. you need to be at 350 or above for it to be a landslide.
"From an optics/non-contextual perspective it would. But if - a massive if still - it winds up something like that, I look at it like a close football game where the winning team scores a touchdown or two late to run up the score bigger than what the first 58 minutes of the game say it was."
It is according to 538's definition.
Biden: We're on to COVID
"Once Pennsylvania turns blue and it seems stable, they will all call it Biden.  Everyone knows it will happen.  They don't want to call before the flip."
"Oh shit, what kind?"

How often are threads posted
"yes, counting happening as we speak and SOS expects to have results tonight maybe 9pm or 12am est"
They could hit a threshold where remaining votes aren't enough to change the outcome
the lady from the conference isaid that they be done by tomorrow
"Almost certainly, the person in charge of elections said they expect results to me almost fully out tonight"
Apparently the PA governor issued a statement that the counting will be done today and results should be ready tonight
because PA said they would be done counting tonight.
"Biden is less than 100k away from flipping the state, it’s going to be called once it flips."
"Once Biden passes Trump, it'll almost certainly be called."
"Their Secretary of State said we will have results by Friday, so it should be tonight!"
They’re ahead of schedule so says the Sec of State
"Yup, they’re still counting"
"Won't happen tonight, Allegheny county stopped counting until tomorrow, which is effectively Pittsburgh. 

Other counties will still count, but I think Allegheny is going to decide it for Biden.

Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
"Lol, concession speech? I’ll have some of what you’re smoking."
"No, I think that's it."
326 not counted
Those 326k votes have not been counted or reported and are being counted as we speak.
326k is mail-in ballots only. The total left is 395k per NYT
"Pennsylvania SoS said they are not reporting all votes yet, but they just dumped over 30k so who knows?"
"The people holding the trials at Nuremberg were 'part of the problem'..? The writers of the Emancipation Proclamation, part of the problem? We gotta knock off this 'we must be tolerant of intolerance' shit. My dad fought in WWII and he'd have considered \*that\* mentality 'part of the problem'."

Please don’t talk about my plans
He’d better hurry because I heard Aliens we’re gonna blow up the White House.
no lol
Literally the only reason I voted
Truth?  Thats what obama tried to do until Trump stopped him
How do you know we haven't already done it?
All to erase the second amendment. If it's not on the bill of rights it doesn't exist.
How many votes not counted.?
Seems that way since he's averaging 71 percent of the vote... That puts him at ~35k more votes.
Love it!
Someone should write a script
make sure to say you vote for trump twice- just like he asked you to
"For the record, both forms have file uploads. Inject away."
"john q public
address: 1600 pennslyvania ave
please describe the fraud you witnessed: ""some jackass is on TV trying to stop legally cast votes from being counted. please stop this madman."""
"There is, He's just laughing at us."
It’s ridiculous. There should be a playbook for an overall counting method for every state.
All those states also is likely not done especially California which is at 70 something %. We only care bout these states because they are close. Like Alaska is really behind
Are you kidding? California only has 66% of votes reported. This happens EVERY ELECTION. Just happens that this time there's more mail ins and some decisive states are very close.
"Eh that’d make the whole process federal - something you don’t want when states enjoy their right to treat their elections how they want. 

They really should’ve anticipated that a metric shit Ton of mail-in ballots were coming in and allocated more resources to counting them."
"As GA Election Director (or similiar) pointed out, FL still has more outstanding ballots to count than GA. Nobody cares about FL since the race isn't close enough.

A lot of states are still counting ballots. They simply don't have close margins to justify attention."
To be fair. Vermont is at 92% and cali on 66%.
"Uhm, California is at 66%. You're just not annoyed because it isn't a close race"
Probably because more people voted this year than in the past
"It's because different states have different election laws as to when they can start counting. For example, some are allowed to count mail-ins first, even before election day, while others wait until all in-person election day results are counted."
There’s a lot of votes and procedures to make sure it’s done right and fairly?  Better to take time and be accurate vs hurry up and make mistakes.
"Tbf the ""true"" vote will be a bigger margin for Biden than 2016 was. Unfortunately the EC is heavily GOP biased so it looks closer than it is.


Also, Biden may still end up with 300+ EC votes, which against an incumbent, is pretty good."
"Y'all need some serious rhetoric change, mostly from the right but also on the left. Who knows.."
"Thank you for spelling “eke” correctly.  I bet you can use “pique” and “cue” correctly too. So, what say you? “Toe the line” or “Tow the line”?"
Biden is 9k votes behind trump
"Gambling sites put him at 80% chance. They're trustworthy enough at this point.

I don't know why, but I trust them."
"Gap is 9k. It's gonna be very close, recount guaranteeed."
"The votes they're counting right now heavily favor him, just like in PA, and he seems to be on pace to flip both states. PA more likely than GA imo."
he needs to maintain 60% of the remaining 43k votes and he's averaging ~70% right now with a 9k lead
It will be close
Bout 40k votes left to count last I heard. Only 12k behind. They are mostly mail in votes in which Biden has been receiving the majority by 77%
They are not.  It's probably going to be within a few thousand votes either way.
"The biggest place Trump could’ve picked up votes is done reporting, and most of the ballots were for Biden.  Only Biden-leaning places left to report in any significant numbers."
All depends if the percentage for Biden vs. Trump stays how it's been for the last several hours / last day.
"Votes remaining are mostly in blue areas where Biden percentages of votes are over 70%. 

Either way recount is expected but looks winnable"
Because we read the current news and are watching the polls?
Because the remaining ballots are from heavily Democratic districts and mail-in ballots already skew very Democratic.
If the current trend continues he should pass Trump
"People will say math and patterns but really, everyone is hopefully more than anything"
"Possibly. There's less than 10,000 votes between them now, with a bunch still outstanding."
"We're not sure, but if trends hold, he has a very good shot at winning it."
If there's 40k left and he needs 62% he's gotten about 75% of mail ins. So it's just math.
Biden only needs to win 60% of the remaining ballots to pass Trump. He l's currently averagijg at 70%.
Basically the people looking at the rate Biden is winning the remaining votes and how many votes remain to be counted and estimate the percent change from there. That estimate currently favors Biden.
"A lot of the remaining votes are seemingly from Savannah, and should be very Biden friendly."
"Remaining votes are said to be heavily favoured to dems, because of the location and being mail-in ballots"
It's going to be extremely close but it seems likely Trump will edge it out just barely.
"Its EXTREMELY close with less than 10,000 votes left to be counted. Trump has only a 0.2% lead over Biden so yeah...its insanely fucking close.

https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=Current+Georgia+election+results"
"GA has ebbed and flowed in terms of Biden's chance to win over the past ~24 hours, IMO.  It's not at its best right now but still looks doable.  There are ~38K votes to count, and Trump holds a ~9.5K lead.  This means Biden needs to win 24K of the 38K votes (giving Trump 14K, a 10K differential to bring Joe into the lead).  That's ~63.1%.  GA's votes today have come in ~68% for Biden.  Sources are reporting that the remaining votes to come in are a good chunk of blue-leaning-county mail in ballots (favor Biden) as well as some military and provisional votes (should cancel out).  So it's looking quite possible, but hard to say.  

Also, PA looks more or less in the bag."
"Well no one is sure if Biden can take GA, but there is a possibility. There is about a 0.2 gap between Biden and Trump (about 9,000 votes). 

According to [this](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html) there are about 49,000 votes that still need to be counted. Most of these ballots that still need to be counted are from predominately Democratic areas. So there is a chance for Biden to win by a slim margin. But its good to remember possibilities are only possibilities.

Edit: 43,000"
"Tell me more, Papi😩"
I would like to overdose on this please.
I'm really curious how GA runoffs go without Trump on the ballot.
"I don't think it was black lives matter I think it was the defund the police movement that maybe drove some white votes to Trump.

But yes we all owe the african american community big for this election."
It really is. I don’t see it happening now but it was rampant the first night. Saw people saying the Dem party needed to forget about black people cause they weren’t helping them.
I don’t think that’s right. States with the most black voters are actually red.
"White women got the blame last time, black people for Bernie's loss in the primaries, and BLM and Cubans this time. Anything to avoid confronting the idea that America just....*is* this, more than we're comfortable with, and we can't shove that on one group or another."
"Most of the districts that actually saw riots voted overwhelmingly for Biden. So if anything, it’s the media’s interpretation of the protests."
ok mate
"I haven't really seen anyone saying that personally.  I have seen many, many white Republicans and Conservatives (including my parents and my wife's parents) say that, but not really any liberals."
"An old white man who's a centrist career Democrat is tenuously leading.

I don't think this country is ready to elect a smart, successful woman of color. :-("
"If you want a sure way for Republicans to take the office, there it is"
God forbid if that were ever to happen.
God I hope so
I think he'd save that for lame duck. But you're right he could certainly say some dangerous things.
Honestly yeah :/
"WH broadcasts all press conferences on their website. I doesn’t matter what MSM hides, they’ll see it straight from the source"
"He could just tweet that. 

He's going to try to be presidential while also spewing absolute lies about fraud and winning."
"Nah, Trump resigns to get a pardon from Pence making Pence 46"
God I hope this happens.
Establishment republicans know that Trump will remain in control of the republican base. They step out of line and they'll get primaried just like every other republican who refused trumpism.
Dems are nearly as incompetent as the American electorate. Great for the GOP. This country is utterly fucked.
"I personally can't see GOP turnout ever being like this again without a cult of personality like Trump leading the way. As for Democrats, would definitely love to see them get younger, fresh faces out there. Worked so well with Obama"
"There are talks amongst the establishment of deposing Pelosi with someone who is still relatively moderate but younger and more willing to court progressives. Trump was defeated but not dominated, and with luck this is the slap in the face dems need to stop tilting right."
To early let her shine in politics first because wtf can she do after being president for the government?

Ya free shit for everyone so we can all sit on reddit and play video games!!
Mail in ballots?
"Mail in ballots have more rules, so they are harder to count."
"Aren't most in person votes done electronically? Mail in ballots have to be unpacked, organized and counted. I could see it taking some time."
thats how a lot of things go. I work in B2B sales and we recently had to reach out to all of our 200 plus clients for contract renewals and we got 90% of them fairly easy. We spent 70% of the effort getting the last 10%. I wonder if there's a name for this.
"Seriously, are they only using one machine?"
Volunteers and people are tired.
"Electronically entered during Election Day, all others mail in ballots? Don’t know just a guess"
Mail in have to be opened and unfolded and then verified
Envelopes and checking legitimacy AFAIK
"Mail in ballots are more time consuming.
They have to be checked before opening - checking the signature against the registration books, checking the election logs to make sure they didn't vote in-person.  
Then they open the outer envelope to make sure the security envelope is intact.  
Then they can finally check the ballot to make sure it was filled out properly, and then can finally go into the pile to be scanned."
"Maybe they have to verify each step of the mail in ballot is correct? John Oliver did a bit about it a few weeks ago: https://youtu.be/AytDzZ2ecCc

I imagine verifying all of that is more involved than just looking for an X beside a name. Plus opening the envelope(s). Adds a substantial amount of time I'd guess per ballot compared to the in-person ones. It's also probably slower than previous years because of covid (fewer counters due to social distancing and other public health measures).

That's just my (Canadian) guess though."
"Ok so I might be wrong but I thought I read that the percent were seeing isn’t percentage of ballots, but percentage of counties that have submitted results. Which would mean that the majority of small counties would all be done pretty quick, but the larger cities while only being one fraction of the percent would have the majority of the votes."
Nope.  Not yet.  I think they want to be last to really milk the gambling market.
"[https://twitter.com/NateSilver538](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538)

90% of uncounted ballots are from Clark County very very democratic, NV is pretty much in the bag"
Some new ballots. But not much of a change.
I think 9 PM
NV dragging ass. Nothing yet.
not yet.
Biden has a 1 point lead now. He’s about to win the election
"Nevada isn’t going to report until the weekend, but analysts suggest Trump doesn’t have a path to win there."
"Some, not much"
Nothing significant
yeah
Take all the information you had this morning. It’s exactly the same
"They did, Biden got a larger margin but nothing decisive"
No report. Likely tomorrow or Saturday
nope
They’ll be reporting more over the weekend
Not until tomorrow
They won’t report again until Friday. Biden is in the lead and the majority of the remaining votes are from Clark County (Las Vegas) so it’s extremely unlikely Biden won’t take this.
"There was a report, but not as big an update of votes as we expected. Biden gained a few to push to a 12,000 vote lead, but there are still plenty left to count."
"~~They did. Biden is leading by 431,863 votes to Trump’s 367,279. 63,262 ballots are still outstanding~~

Arizona is Biden’s
PA seems the most satisfying nationally but GA and AZ are so big for the ppl living there (here).
"I live in az, what do you think it's doing to my heart and stomach... Ugh!!"
Closing FAST in PA.  Trump lead down to 90k votes.
"Biden’s got PA, Georgia looking likely"
Biden will win PA. Not a question anymore
"Looks like he's just down by 9,000 now in GA.  90K in PA."
"GA spread less than 10k now.

Biden growing in PA.

Fuck the fat man, keep counting"
"PA seems very likely.  GA is also likely, though less so."
Biden very close in ga
"Biden is gonna take PA  


GA is close so idk"
"Yes (fairly likely) to both, imo."
"likely in PA, toss up in Georgia."
Biden now within 10k votes in GA. I have no idea how many votes are still unreported though.
Trump's lead in GA just shrank to 9.5k. It's possible.
"very likely, and better than even"
Both PA and GA look really good for Biden right now. I’m more confident in PA though.
"So far he seems to be on pace to comfortably flip it, but it's not over until it's over."
Both look likely
"Pa Looks good, Ga seems unlikely except will be razor thin difference."
"Yes PA looks very likely. In Georgia, Biden is on pace to overtake with less than 10k trump lead, but it will be incredibly close"
"Good. Yes. 

It will be close, whatever happens."
Yes and yes
Georgia is .2% difference rn! In PA  he seems to still have a shot- 88% counted and only 100k from trump. AP source.
"PA likely for Biden.  Georgia 10k votes away with 99% reporting in, so doable, but still in the air."
"Last I heard Biden needed about 60% of the outstanding ballots in PA and 64% of the outstanding votes in GA respectively to break his way in order to take the lead in those two states.

The outstanding ballots are from very blue areas and the mail in ballots have been breaking his way better than those margins in both states.

My understanding is chances are looking very good in PA and there is a definite shot in GA."
"70% Biden win PA

30% Georgia

70% election 

My source is myself from watching this election"
Biden has a really good shot at PA considering he’s winning up to 80% of the votes in these batches and still hundreds of thousands of ballots left. GA on the other hand will be razor thin close but I think Biden takes it.

"It depends on how much comes in from PA still tonight. I think they'll call it before Biden takes the lead there, but it could be an hour, or it could be tomorrow."
I’d go to sleep
"It all depends on PA. If Biden wins PA, Biden wins. If he loses PA, this shit goes on forever.

No states are gonna finish today unless they get some reinforcements to count.
My guess is later this evening (10/11) EST
"Go to bed. It'll be late, and staying up to watch won't make it go any faster"
Sleep well. I'm sure we'll still be here tomorrow waiting and waiting. Hah
"AZ should be uploading some counts in about 3-4 hours. GA might announce more tonight, but most wont be done till tomorrow. PA will probably be Friday night into the weekend. NV probably won’t be done till next week."
Thanks guys :)
I think at least 6 hours.
You are not too old at all!! You can totally do it man
I don't think anyone is ever too old to go back to college
"I went back at 27, who cares!"
Yeah. You're right.
Nonsense. People of all ages go to college. Follow your dreams.
Similar boat here. Almost 30 and thinking about a career change. Really don't want that extra student loan debt though.
I went back at 32. Only you kepp yourself from doing the things you want. Get it son.
"You're never too old, friend. No profession turns down a skilled worker if they know what they're doing. Knowing law is an incredibly handy skillset in our highly stratified society."
"I graduated college at 28.

Trust me, it's so much easier in your late 20's."
Never to late to follow a dream!
"Definitely not, plenty of 30+s in law schools. Northwestern only even takes applicants with significant work experience"
"You're not. I got my diploma at 24. Finished college at 30. Am still thinking about law school in my early thirties. I wish I had just gone right away, but we decided to start a family."
"28 might be OLDER and you’d be in class with people younger than you, but assuming you went through law school at a normal pace you’d still have YEARS of practicing law before retirement age. It’s better to have less years of a good career ahead of you than NO years of a good career."
Nah brother I started medicine this year at 28 :D
"When your 40, 28 will feel like a whimsical youthful age and anyone 10 years younger than you will be unbearable. So don't wait."
28 is def not too old for law school.
"Think of it this way. Next year you'll be 29 and won't be in school for a law degree. Best time was yesterday, second best time is now. Get on it and live"
As if.  Go back
Nah. Do it!
Law school is three years. It's not too late
I really think it’s because of the post. I heard somewhere that like 20 of on time mail in ballots didn’t make it to the count because of the Usps fuckups
"He's 8% above John King's 70% he did his math with and that 70% still gives him a 40k lead.  I think he'll be OK, though I agree, I wish there were more ballots."
It's gonna be known on Monday the way things are going

I dont know. I'm in Arkansas and all the Republicans are losing their fucking minds about these elections being fraudulent. Straight up threats of violence.
It’s all talk except for maybe a very small percentage of people who take it too far just like anything else.
"Are you living in another planet?

48% of Americans voted for an openly despotic, anti-democratic oligarch who openly declared his intention to try to steal this election months ago. 

And a not-insubstantial number of those people are willing to get violent if called to do so. 

""Trusting the system"" to act as a check on Trump is how we got here."
"ive seen a lot of conservatives saying shit like ""we arent blm/antifa, we wont start looting and burning shit down if we dont get our way."" Which is like, gross, but i'll take it"
"I can't imagine being optimistic after this in the short term. Super close election where 48% of the country voted for an authoritarian turd, a lot of uncertainty on how a transition of power will go, what Trump will do leading up the inauguration day, what (if any) legal action will taken against Trump after Biden is inaugurated, when the first shot of the second American Civil War will happen...there's a lot that can happen in the next few months. Personally, I don't think I'll feel optimistic about America's future until after the 2022 midterms depending on how they go."
It's safe to get excited now. Hell people were calling it yesterday with a 200k gap in pa.
Some incredibly stupid crazy illegal shit no one can bring themselves to describe in literal terms?
Biden just flipped Erie County...I don't know if overconfidence is even in play anymore.

If they just need to make sure that other people agree that vampires aren't voting then tell them that. Or tell them that you just read online where lots of people agree that dead people aren't voting. Its not a lie."

"According to 538 - the margin in GA is now 12,768 with 47,277 to go. 

It's obviously going to be insanely close, but by my quick math, for Biden to pass Trump in the state, he would need to win about 64% of remaining, which is well within what other states (besides AZ) have shown with mail.  But that's to barely win, close enough that a recount actually COULD change things.  

If he won 75% or so, though, the totals would be something like:

Trump - 2,451,497

Biden - 2,465,611"

"No. But seeing as the Republicans made every effort to delay ballot delivery, refused to invest in infrastructure to account for greater mail in turn out, etc it’s not surprising it is taking so long. It is annoying though because I feel for every hour it’s not called the Trump supporters are more firm in their belief that it’s fraud."
No
2000 called and said hi.
"Yes, technically. Although sometimes it can be projected with high confidence/ doesn't matter when the candidate wins by healthy margins."
Therea usually a winner by now.
"It usually takes this long (and longer) to count all of the ballots, yes. Usually most voters vote in person so we have conclusive calls before this. However it's very normal for counts to change over several days past the election. 

If republicans had allowed for early counting, this could have been avoided."
"Yes and no. Final votes take up to a few weeks to tally, but the number of absentee ballots and the razor thin margins of this election mean that the statistical results are unable to be displayed until more of the absentee ballots are counted, which simply take more time than in-person."
"Results? Yea it can take up to a month. 

Media projections go off of unofficial results and have experienced and trained pollsters making them backed up by boatloads of accurate data. They can be made within a few days or if the spread is wide enough, on election night into the morning after. 

But yea, this is not aberrant; only in how much mail in vote they have to process and the proportion of the total vote it makes up."
"I believe it's normal to take this long to count all the votes, just not normal that there isn't a clear winner by now."
"in reality, yes.  counting always takes a long time.

The main thing is that usually, there's MUCH less mail in ballots and early voting.  So, they just starting counting Nov3.  So, by getting almost all of the votes all at once, they can just count away and can see the trend.

&nbsp;


Another wrinkle in all this is that either state legislature or the people in charge of that state put in rules to delay counting the early/mail-in votes.  That means that the party that advocated to vote early and vote through mail because of the pandemic (democrats) had a lot of votes counted later (after nov.3 votes were counted) and the party that pushed their voters to ignore the virus and vote in person on nov.3 had their votes counted first.

&nbsp;

All this has been by design by groups.  They wanted the early votes and mailed in ballots to be delayed in counting.  For what reasons?  Well, I guess you'll ahve to look at the news to figure out why they wanted that.

&nbsp;

EDIT:

anyway, got off-track.  the whole point is that yes, it always takes longer.  Other years, they ""call it"" faster because most votes come from just 1 day.  There is no delaying counting of early ballots.  And you can see the trend from 1 day of voting.  But with early ballots being delayed in counting (again, by design), then it makes it more difficult to see the trend."
No. The reason its taking so long is because republican state legislatures banned their state election commissions from counting mail-in votes before election day. The reason they did this was so that election night would mainly be same-day votes and make it look like Trump is winning / has won.
"no.   


Counting usually takes this long (usually weeks after election day). Usually the winner is obvious after a day.  


Since this is so freaking close, and mail in votes take longer... this election is much much slower."
"No.  For this election, it’s due to the fact of counting mail-in ballots."
Depends on how close they are. The 2000 election took something like 20 days with re-counts and court cases.
short answer is enough.

Trump could win it. But it won't matter since he's losing PA

"Yeah, Trump has really caused a mess. It’s going to take a long time to calm the crazies."
I have a feeling that trump may have actually gotten a boost in some states from people afraid of a nationwide quarantine/shutdown so he prolly has not as much diehard support as opposed to people just rolling with it it probably would be in both parties best interest for republicans to cut their losses right now. What the country really needs is someone big like Mitch or Pence to concede on behalf of the president in a way that it can’t be refuted that all ballots counted are legit
"Canadian here, I suspect quite a few will fight hard because they've done things that aren't kosher."
"Looks like some are already breaking away, starting with the ""stop the count"" bullshit Trump tried to pull and Pence just outright ignored that message and said, ""count the votes""."
They have no morals at this point. They are soulless husks. They will fight it.
"Not really Forsyth is all but done in the metro area, most of the 43k left is in Biden leaning counties"
Not that are still reporting in an impactful way
"One in western GA but all it has is mail-in-ballots and it's not that many. The large bulk of remaining mail in ballots to be counted are in Savannah and Atlanta, heavily democratic areas. There is a path for Biden to win in GA."
"Forsyth and Floyd are heavy red with Forsyth having a substantial population. Forsyth pretty much done counting though. 

This is going to be really close."
"My county was at 77% Trump vote - and 4000 ballots just got counted - it went roughly 50/50 - now Trump is down to 71% . So even if the counties left are ""trump"" counties in the current voted numbers - it still remains that Biden supporters were using the mail-in process more."

"Go take a look at the county by county results.  the chances for GA is pretty good, but it's all in the Atlanta population center.  New Orleans could, but politics is different there. 

MS authorizing medical MJ is amazing, but not a political shift. 
Al?   I'd expect lynchings."
"Doubtful. States turning blue all have one thing in common - a population center that is attractive to educated (mostly young) people, who move there from out of state. GA has ATL, VA had the DC area/Richmond, NC has the Triangle and Charlotte, CO had Denver, Texas has Dallas/Austin/Houston, etc.

None of those states really have that. New Orleans is a big city but doesn't have a ton of industry or attraction to outsiders moving there. MS and AL are just plain devoid of big cities."
Honestly it is really hard to say. When I was in it was like maybe a 60 red 40 blue split. But it is almost impossible to guess because it will depend on where whereever they are from.

50 % threshold
Georgia Senate candidates must reach at least 50% of the vote in order to win outright. Perdue has dropped below that threshold in the last day.
"He needs over 50% and he doesn't have it atm. Even if he is ahead, it goes to a special election.

People also think the lack of Trump on the ballots will depress republican turnout and allow the dems to win."
He doesn't have 50% of the votes because of JoJo
Looks like both will have runoffs
If the current numbers hold it will go to runoff as well. It's currently at Purdue with 49.9.
Georgia has the rule that you need over 50% of the vote to avoid a runoff.
In GA there is a rule that says you have to win 50% of the vote or more for Senate. So if Perdue is at 49% they have a run off in January.
"One of the candidates has to hit 50%. If none of them hit fifty, it goes to a runoff of the top two, which would be ossoff and Perdue. Third party candidates are creating the gap beneath fifty."
If neither candidate gets 50% +1 it goes to a runoff.  At that point it's a matter of getting out the vote in January for both runoffs.
"In Georgia, you have to have at least 50% of the total vote in your favor or no victor is declared, there is a runoff (scheduled early January)."
"If no candidate gets 50% or greater, it goes to runoff. So Purdue can be ahead by tons as long as he is at 49.999% it goes to runoff."
There is a runoff no matter what if the leading candidate doesn't achieve > 50% of the votes.
"""Winner"" needs > 50% of total vote. Perdue is leading Ossoff, but he isn't above 50%. Thus, runoff."
"In Georgia to avoid a runoff you need 50% + 1 vote.

Perdue has dropped to 49.9, so the race will go to a runoff if it stays under 50%, which is now very likely."
GA requires you get over 50% to win outright. Purdue currently juuuust below.
Georgia's rules state if one candidate doesn't get at least 50% it goes to a runoff between the top two. So at this stage it's not really Perdue vs Ossoff so much as it's Perdue vs Everyone Else Combined.
"In GA, if no candidate gets 50% +1 vote, than it automatically triggers a run off between the top two vote getters in that election. The mail in vote counting today in GA has ticked Perdue down to just 49.95 percent basically, so assuming trends hold and he doesn't go back up, there will be a run off between Ossoff and Perdue."
I genuinely don't see how this is possible
That guy can suck his own dick. He's in a different league.
Georgia has no automatic recount. Candidates can request a recount if the race is within 0.5
"No automatic recount, has to be within 0.5% to request: [https://ballotpedia.org/Recount\_laws\_in\_Georgia](https://ballotpedia.org/Recount_laws_in_Georgia)"
0.5 % was what I read

It’s not uncommon for cabinet members to prepare an undated resignation letter during transition
>defense officials say Esper prepared his letter because he is one of the Cabinet officials long expected to be pushed out after the election.
Rumor was that he was gonna be on the chopping block after the election like Fauci.
Probably so he doesn't have to direct people in the civil war Trump wants.
"> secretary of defense

probable because he knows Trump wont win, so most of them would be kicked off their post, some of them would want to go quietly, means resign.


remember its better to resign rather than being fired."
Not yet. Bad if he does as he gained a spine after getting embarrassed by the DC army deployment. Replacement would be even more of a trump toady.
Get it!!!
Can and will.
"Yes, if it’s under 1% I believe"
"Yes, as long as he pays for it haha. The more likely option is for him to try to make the PA vote illegitimate"
"My understanding is he can ask for a recount whenever he wants. If it's over a 1% margin, his campaign has to pay for it. But recounts only seem to alter votes in the low hundreds, not thousands."
ga law says if it's within half a percent they can get a recount
"Sure if it's less than 1% a lot of states allow recount requests. I read somewhere that there was one state where between 1 and 0.25% the candidate has to pay the costs, and <0.25% it's automatic and paid by the state."
"He can ask for a recount anywhere less than 1% difference. Less than 0.25% state paid, more than that his campaign pays"
"If the win is within a certain margin, a recount is automatic.  Outside of that, if it's within a second certain margin, you can trigger a recount but if you LOSE you then have to pay for it."
"Sure, each state has their own rules. I know pa is the margin has to be .5% or less. And who knows how the recount would go."
"Yes for GA. As long as the margin is within 0.5, a campaign can request a recount"
"Depends on how tight, but if Nevada and Arizona stay blue it would be a waste of time anyways."
"It will be automatic in PA if its under .5% margin, i don't believe there is a provision for recount outside that margin.

GA is by candidate request, and there doesn't seem to be a margin requirement.

So yes Trump will either get a recount (margin dependent) in PA, or can request one in GA if he doesn't like the results.

Similarly Biden can request a recount in NV, but in AZ he can not it is automatic if fewer than 200 votes, or .1% of Margin."
"he is already asking, but recounts would just delay the inevitable at this point.

recount rarely move the needle more than a few thousands votes, GA will be very close but PA should be strongly Biden, and Biden likely will also get 270 from other states.

it is like contesting who came first at a swimming race during the last lap, while your favourite is drowning and the competitor is swimming strong"
Ya he would have to pay. I think recalls can be requested if the difference is less than 0.5%
Probably. Kinda want it to happen so I can watch his increasing insanity and then disappointment when recount is blue
"I don't know, but at the rate Biden is winning mail-in ballots in PA, he'll win by 233K votes."
Just means margin will be 40k vs 100k
She said 350...
Which one is correct??
I absolutely believe this guy is a registered democrat
">https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1324483936089767936

That ""registered democrat"" sure loves Trump a lot."
"""im a registered democrat"" sure buddy"
So 630 pacific
I thought they already called the press lid?
"He’s the MSNBC reporter who I want to spoon me the most.

(Runners-up: Gadi Schwartz, Vaughn Hilliard and Cal Perry.)"
Just turn off the TV.
"Imagine finally being free of Trump, and then him coming back and winning in 2024. Fuck that.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely do not want him to win, but I'd almost rather him win this one and just get it out of the way than have to go through all of this again in four years."
So he can keep grifting money from his supporters and pocketing it... you know like exactly why he got into politics in the first place.
"I like the over under on Trump surviving with his diet, strokes(?), and covid living to the 2024 election about as much as I like the over under on Trump sweeping the remaining states and getting to 270..."
Hard to campaign from a non-extradition country.
Didn’t hey just call a lid?
source/link?
My Offspring!!!
What time?
That'll be interesting
Can you link? I need a good laugh.
I love their map where Trump is somehow in the lead
Ugh
Will he address the nation to concede or his supporters to stand by?
That's seriously fucked up
630 est
It's gonna be hilarious
Yes. Not sure what he's gonna say.
"As painful as it is for us, imagine how painful it has been for Trump watching his re-election chances just slowly melt away. Literally every couple hours it got just a little more likely that he’ll lose. And then a little more. And then a little more. To the point where it’s seemingly inevitable, but not quite there, but you know it’s coming and there’s nothing that can be done to stop the inevitable."
What time is it for us Europeans?
That sounds dangerous frankly.
"Somehow Democrats, who have been overran by the radical left, didn't do anything about Senate elections as well. Even though that would have required fraud in only a few places."
But I need my liver!
Nah I want to be alive to see his defeat.
But I don't want alcohol poisoning.
No thanks I’m not suicidal lmao
"No thanks, I don't want alcohol poisoning."
Kaitlin Collins is bae.
Mine would be Tara Sethmayer
"Yeaaaah! finally, thats  where im  from. im  glad we also got the representative because lehigh is notorious for splitting votes"
Watching for the same reason... Watters is devastated
Going for the easy bet I see.
"Probably a lot of dog whistling and name dropping, if I had money I would invest in a private security firm cause he's definitely about to let go of the leash either way things turn out..."
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.

"Me either, no need to hear an old man yell at clouds.

I'll get more than enough updates of his stupidity from these threads I'm sure."
"Why wouldn't he? He has no repercussions at this point, right? He's already broke and going to jail. It's a scary place to have such a desperate but still powerful person to have in."
You know that’s everybody’s dads ringtone.
That's okay we have Pennsylvania and Nevada as backup
Still something like 80k left.
Yeah but it has been there for over a day.

In about a half an hour from now... yes.
In 30 minutes.
6:30

yup at 6:30pm
It’s been widely reported that Trump will speak from the White House at 6:30 PM EST.
"I think only the AP and Fox have. CNN, NY Times, ABC and most others haven't."
"if my math is right at the bare min biden needs to 66% of that, tp 228,000 votes to Trump 107,580"
"Hope it picks back up, 66 is cutting it pretty close."
That guys head looks like a deformed penis
that dude is a fucking nutjob
"psh, those ratings"
He didn’t resign. There are reports he readied a letter to resign.
He's invading Pennsylvania.
"Yeah, this should be a wild one!"
"That's his official presidential portrait, and it's unsettling because the man never actually smiles and has no sense of humor."
It would be huge if his lead holds there! May not matter though.

Can you run while incarcerated?
Apparently he's floating the idea!!
He will probably announce so he can raise money and do more events to feed his ego.
"He's a psychopathic narcissist. Typically, when it comes to normal psychopathic narcissists (non-Presidential ones,) when they lose and they're backed into a corner, they kill their whole family."
Thanks for that horrifying mental picture.
He needs to wipe off the tears.  That orange can run.

Nah he's usually late
Nah he's been 45 minutes late in the past.
"a little less, ~59, looking optimistic"
"Different sources say different things, unfortunately. Either there's 326k votes left, or there's near 400k left. I don't know the real answer."
Less. 59.68%.
"At this point the chances of Biden winning all three of AZ, PA and GA seem about even with Trump even winning the election at all.  Chances seem good for Biden to win at least one of those three."
I'm so tempted to not take him seriously anymore but he's still dangerous as fuck.
If a team can pull off the impossible things he talks about. I want that team to lead.
This is what they believe a strong man looks like. L-O-FUCKING-L.
I would love a president willing to cry on live TV instead of being a narcissistic sociopath.
He doesn't need to. He's already turned the page to being presidential
No need. This is embarrassing for trump.
Down to a few thousand votes
"""It's amazing those mail-in ballots are so one-sided."" Umm... fucking is it, though??"
He knows alright. This speech and frivolous lawsuits was their plan B so they set the stage for it.

"They can't and even if they could, they wouldn't."
"I really doubt they would try to even if an opportunity was given to them. McConnell and Trump's SCOTUS nominees don't have any use for Trump anymore. He already allowed them to control agency appointments and judge appointments to skew things in the Republican's favor. That's all they needed him for. They may be power hungry, but they aren't going to stick their necks out for him or his bs lawsuits that don't have a single legal leg to stand on. They need to focus their energy on their own nefarious agenda for the next 4 years. Trump is useless and a liability to them at this point."

They arent in a hurry because they accept mail in votes a few days after the election

I think GA will be called first
< 10%
"Basically 0.  PA and GA both going to be major, major squeakers"
I don't see how Biden cannot win PA. He's outperforming what he needs (58%) by 12-14 points.
I wouldn't worry about it.  Ga is about to flip and so is PA. Oh.. and Kelly is still up by 100k
Maricopa. 4.2 million people.
Kornacki gets me hyped king calms my nerves
John King all day
"John King, no question."
Yuma and Maricopa are the only two unaccounted for. Really don’t see Biden losing. The last ballot dump out of there was around 25k and only 1k went to trump.
"It's mostly maricopa 

The shitty SOS there says the state maxs out at 70k votes per day and refuses to have her people count over night.

Will be 5 days before AZ is counted completely"
"Maricopa, a little from Washoe, and some tiny number of ballots from the rest of the state"
"I am confused, isn't Arizona counted already"
he doesn't need if he can keep 80% in philly
It looks like he might get it with Philly
18k. I believe it’s split between Gwinnett and dekalb/ Biden leading counties
"18000 according to my man, the CBC"
I think its down to 13k ....
You just described what someone thought up 15-20 years ago in Texas lol. Theyre  well on the way. It will be purple in 2024
"You can't just build a city.  It has to have a reason for being there.  China tried this several times and as a result there are now ghost cities there.

I am not even going to get into the mess that is the politics of the Texas University system."
"I can't give an educated answer for what I'm assuming is complicated but 
1.) I think thats happening already to a degree? Isn't Austin pretty liberal and Dallas is getting there?
2.) As a liberal, I don't think I would move to a VERY red state as I don't want to be surrounded by conservatives and overly religious people (I have no problem with religion per say but I don't want it to expected as the ""norm"" and that people should be religious or one particularly religion. 

If my company gave me the option of moving to a new city that is liberal but in a red state, or work from home and continue to live in my blue state, I would pick work from home in my state. Just look at the differences in blue states vs red states for COVID? I don't trust that if I live in Texas or Florida or other red states that there will be serious, science-minded decisions made that will be beneficial to the people."
Why spend the money to create a new city when you (personally as that billionaire) can invest that money in an existing city and make money faster with less risk?
"You can bring the Urban to Texas, but you can't bring the Smarts"
"Texas is like a beautiful man’s brain. Real big, but nothing in it."
Have you ever tried to build a city from scratch?
Why don't they undertake a decades long process of extreme complexity and expense to maybe win a few extra votes in an election?
"What do you mean “build cities”? Who’s gonna build a CITY? Only China does that, via government fiat, no private individual can pay to have a city built. Cities rise and fall due to broad and long-term economic trends and patterns."
"This is a great question that not many people are asking.
Most major cities are located near the coast. And many corporations have their mayor office located in
 these coastal cities. This all allows these cities to generate alot of tax revenue and to fund coastal states. This also applied to the rest of the world. People are moving from interior to the coasts
 If you look at the coast and major cities people are tend to lean to the left due to better education and diversity."

Military voters are actually leaning slightly blue this year
"Still really unsure what he has ever done to earn a single military vote, but that's the world we live in"
I thought military hated trump?
"About 40% of the military votes will be Biden votes, most likely."
That’s 9k thought Chatham still has 17k left to count and it’s leaning Biden
"from what I read, this year they're quite overwhelmingly third party.. at 12%

so, if that maintains, and trump can't get above 50% in the senate, at least we have a double runoff"
...military pro trump against JOE BIDEN?
Some outspoken pro-trump military folks I know shit the fuck up about Trump in recent months. And many prominent military folks have denounced Trump. Bounties and draft dodging.
"> All the military votes will probably be VERY pro Trump, I'm sure.

I wouldn't assume that. If they grew up in GA and that is their home of record then maybe. But some people get stationed there and register to vote there, so their background is different."
"In 2016, military voters cast 5,203 absentee ballots in Georgia, according to the Election Assistance Commission.  

Could be the difference"
"Enlisted are slightly pro-biden and officers are overwhelmingly (almost 3/4) Biden leaning. Mocking dead soldiers, Disparaging Mattis, Ruining relations with military coalition allies and the Kurds, and general fuckery with foreign policy doesn’t win you friends in the military."
"He needs 70% of the 326k to beat Trump by 40k votes.

He is getting 78% currently."
He said if Biden gets 70% he wins
he said he'd win with 70%
Just worked it out and he needs less than 70% to win.
"They said if he gets 70% he would win PA by the margin Trump won PA in 2016.

So 78% is well above"
"Didn’t he say trump needs 33%? Which is 67% for Biden, so wouldn’t King’s 70% mark be fine for Biden?"
Last I heard Biden only needs to pull 60-61% of the remaining ballots
"No - he would win by 40,000 votes if he gets 70%. He’s been getting 78%

Pay attention a bit better"
they might have counted a lot more but just haven’t released it yet
Somebody explain this to my dumb ass
"Your numbers are way off

77% of 326 is 250 so that means donald gets around 70k votes while Biden gets 250k so that means he would win by about 150,000"
he needs 70% (or slightly less)
My math says 63% gets him 208k vs 118k.
No? 65-35 should give Biden net 97.8
"According to CNN he wins even if he only gets 70%, even with 70% he will win with 40k more votes. So at the current pace of 78% it is going well for Biden."
"Not 77 but 64.
90k votes is 28% of 326k.
64% gives him this 28% more than Trump"
"He needs to win 64-65% of the remaining count, so far today he has been winning 78%. If he wins the rest of the count by 70% then Biden wins by 40,000. Looks good for Biden."
67%
"I think the 326k figure is mail-in votes specifically. Still 431,723 total votes left per NYT"
"no, he needs significantly fewer, better numbers here https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html"
John King said if Biden gets 70% of the remaining votes he would win by about 40K votes.
He would need roughly 66%
He needs 60% not 77%
The remaining ballot number is fuzzy. Can't tell if that is the number left to be reported or processed.
"If those numbers are true, Biden needs only 64% of them to win."
70%
"according to [this site](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html), there's still over 431,000 left to be recorded"
"Your math is off. Biden needs 63% (208K to 118K, difference 90K)."
Your math is off he needs 63%
your math is a little off
"Biden needs 64% of remaining ballots.

-118k for trump

-208k for Biden

-Difference of 90k


208/326= 63.4%"
71% percent I believe.
"He needs 60% according to here: https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html

Not every vote has been reported so we'll probably see the 300k number soon, in the next dump."
"Isn't it 64% needed?

326,000-90,000 = 236,000

236,000/2 = 118,000

118,000 + 90,000 = 208,000 (What Biden needs to get of the remaining 326k to tie)

208,000/326,000 = 0.638 ~ 64%

Or am I doing something wrong?"
"So Biden needs 90k of 326k. So if you take the 90 he needs off the top then he needs to split the remaining 236. So he needs 90 plus half of 236, or 90 + 118 = 208k votes that Biden needs.

208k / 326k is roughly 64% of the vote needed."
"Your math is off, it's 64%."
It's going to be insanely close. Same with GA.
OK i get it my math was wrong LMFAO thanks guys
You did your math a little wrong. (Votes Remaining + Vote Differential) / 2 will give you the number of votes Biden needs. You did Votes Remaining / 2 + Vote Differential. It's closer to 65%.

I’d put Kevin in the trump column
"Dwight voted JO20, maybe same as meridith??"
Creed voted for Kanye.
Creed sealed his ballot and then made 500 copies of the envelope to put into the ballot boxes.
Andy would have to be flipped to Biden after his 5th cousin got Covid
"Ryan would vote Libertarian, and Phyllis would vote Trump only because Bob does."
"I think the same as you. Depending on the story arc, darryl can go either way."
"I'd swap Kevin and Ryan around, but the rest I agree with!"
"If D-M is a fair cross-section of Scranton, most of them voted for Trump."
Spot on except Kelly would have 100% voted for Kanye
Kelly voted Kanye
I have Oscar down as a Log Cabin type.
"Erin voted for Kanye

Creed voted for himself"
No way Andy is not a republican
I would’ve thought Michael for Biden
Dwight would be Jo Jorgensen but the rest look good
"Trump- Michael (on accident though), Ryan (although he claimed to vote Biden), Meredith, Andy(he's from a rich family remember)

Biden- Pam and Jim, Oscar, Kelly, Erin, Toby, Stanley, Gabe, Dwight (although he'd prefer Jo)

Forgot to vote- Kevin"
Kanye - Creed
"Michael would vote Trump until Pam finds out and shames him. Micheal would have a one on one chat with Jim, where he'd complain about Pam and assume Jim is voting Trump too. Jim would say, ""You know I'm voting for Biden, right? Micheal, Trump is the *worst*. He's Dwight, except with less heart.""

Micheal would pause, and go, ""What? Oh, no, I'm voting Biden too.""

And then he would, even though nobody could prove it."
"Michael votes for Kanye because he thinks everyone will think it’s a hilarious joke. Cue looks of horror from most of the office, and Jim Jim’s the camera."
I think Andy would vote Trump.
Nah my girl Meredith voted for Biden. Rest are spot on though
Creed voted Kanye
"Nah, Meredith would definitely be pro choice and vote Biden."
"Trump: Angela, Andy, Phyllis, Jim, Gabe

Biden: Pam, Oscar, Kelly, Stanley, Erin, Darryl, Michael, Toby, Kevin  

Independent: Dwight"
"AZ should stay blue, the majority of outstanding votes are Pima (HEAVY biden) and Maricopa (biden 60/40)"
They both most likely are smh
I want him as president!
Fax
"By this point, John King has finger calluses that would make any guitar player jealous from all the furious touchscreening."
"As a straight dude, he’s definitely a babe. He’s got that John Lewis fire to him too."
"Warnock is kinda sexy too.. in a refined, scholarly way. Vote sexy, GA"
Ossof is so hot right now
Ain't he though 😍

"When I think of southern states I could tolerate, I often think Atlanta area, NC or Texas."

First lord?
It would be Second Gentleman.
"Second Gentleman, I think"
"I think ""Second Gentleman"""
"Second Gentleman, I believe."
First Lord.
Second gentleman?
Asking the important questions over here
Second Dude
"He would probably be First Gentleman, if they want to keep things formal"
Second dudemeister
Second Gentleman?
"I think they'll still use Second Man, as the President is surely First Man"
Second Gentleman... Second Spouse... Second Partner...
The best man? Wait. That’s weddings...
First gentleman!
Well you don’t want to overdo it
"There’s no way McConnell let’s anything like that pass, he’s going to obstruct everything for the next two years"
"That would be idiotic on their part. They prematurely called Arizona. In fact, they were the first to call Arizona I believe. They got a lot of heat from AZ governor and Trump campaign. Even CNN was questioning their decision. If they called Nevada before cnn and stuff, they would get a lot of heat again. It’s better to just be cautious. I like CNN’s approach."
"People were saying the same thing about Arizona, now they are telling me it looks good for trump in AZ. People are killin me!"
Ga alone is enough
I don’t think AZ or NV are needed if Biden gets PA
Win Nevada
NV and GA still exceeds 270 for Joe.
"If Biden wins PA it’s over. AZ, NV, GA won’t matter."
Georgia plus Nevada works too
"Nah, NV and Georgia would be enough. Biden isn't going to lose AZ though."
PA or NV
"No, Nevada would put Biden over 270"
Trump needs all 4 to win. If he loses any Biden wins
GA + NV is enough.
Or NV
If we win Georgia we would need either PA or NV to avoid a tie
Georgia band Nevada would do it
"AZ takes 11, GA gives 16. Again, one more is needed."
"Winning Georgia but losing Arizona would put Biden at 269, so he could win with Nevada or Pennsylvania."
"If Biden held Nevada and won Georgia, he wins"
"Georgia has more EC votes than AZ. If if Biden gets GA and NV it’s over, same as AZ and NV."
If Joe wins Nevada and any of the remaining states joe wins
If Ga is won then NV still clinches
GA + NV is a win
"Georgia only gets us to 269, so we need another state (NV or PA)"
"Winning PA means Biden wins no matter what.  If he loses PA, then he has to win any 2 of the states left besides Alaska."
"Depends on Nevada. GA+NV=Biden to 275

Barring someone discovering 25,000 dead Democrat voters in a Milwaukee cemetery"
Georgia is worth more. 16 vs 11. It'd still be down to Nevada
Georgia has more votes than AZ.. it wouldn't change anything
"Would be a good trade. AZ has 11 votes, GA 16. Add Nevada and Biden got it."
"If Biden wins Georgia he’d be sitting at 269.  At worst it’s a tie and goes to the house.  At best Biden wins with any state, So Nevada, PN or NC would win it."
"It's over then. It's good for 16. The total of Arizona and Nevada

Incorrect: I don't know my numbers"
Georgia and Nevada would do it
If AZ is lost to Trump and Georgia goes to Biden then it will come down to literally any state because if trump wins all of the remaining then it would be a tie
No... Nevada?
"Biden can lose AZ, GA, NV, and NC and still win if he gets PA."
Nevada still in play
"If we win Nevada, which is almost certain, Biden would just win."
No in that case Biden could lose Pennsylvania but win Nevada and win the whole thing. All you have to do is add up to 270 electoral votes or more.
"No. PA alone or GA and NV would do it.

Trump needs both GA and PA to get to 270."
"PA alone would be enough regardless what the others do.

&#x200B;

Nevada + Georgia would comfortably put him over the finish line, though the count in Georgia would be close as hell.

&#x200B;

Nevada + AZ would put him right at 270, which would technically be enough, but a single faithless elector could fuck everything right up."
Potentially Nevada. It'd be **275** \[Per AP (264) -  AZ (11)  + GA (16) + NV (6) **to 263** (214 + AZ (11) + NC (15) + PA (20) + AL (3)\].
"Arizona has more electoral college votes, so all he would need is Georgia + Nevada.

 Biden basically just needs any two of:

 Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, 

OR

Just Pennsylvania."
"Pennsylvania would be enough right now, without Nevada.

Nevada + Arizona OR Nevada + GA would also be enough.

Only getting Georgia would bring it to an equal split at 269/269. The president is then chosen by the House. The House members get one vote per STATE however, not per member."
Georgia Nevada does it
Never heard of it. Looks..... badass
It’s the nation‘s concerned forehead.
"4 years of reporting on trump will do that to a man.  
Lets hope if Biden wins, we can raise the brow."
That’s his secret
He always looks so disappointed. I would be too if I had to report on Trumps dumb shit all the time.
He has to interview Republicans.
"The stick up his ass shifted a little, and it's pinching."
"He's retiring in 2022. 

John Fetterman for senate in 2022!!


I hope so at least. Would also love to see Josh Shapiro on more of a national stage after how he's handled this whole debacle."
He's only 58..
Let him. Shit still won't go his way in the end.
"As much as it might feel like it, we’re not living in a sit com"
I skipped all the seasons with Nelly
7 stages of grief
There were good old days?
Their analysts probably told them 2 hours ago that NV was going to Biden and it’s all over. I’m 100% convinced they are holding back on that news to they don’t piss off all the Republicans.
That's what I've been waiting for. Once fox is gone it's over
"They're excited about being the outsiders again, which is where they're most comfortable."
"Kinder than ""spawn"" I guess."
Connotation? It's another word for children...
It's a jab. He calls them his spawn lol
I guess it’s better than “spawn”
"Anyone else would say ""children"" or ""family"" but he keeps up with the ""offspring"" and ""spawn"" and I'm just loving it xD"
Oh he's definitely jabbing. Tapper is bitter and petty and I am HERE for it.
I have a feeling it's going to be barely short of a straight up call for civil unrest.
"https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1324219729595289601?s=20

Others agree. The last counted are expected to be independents which have gone for Biden so far."
NPR is simply using AP reporting.
The correction there is that there are only around 49k outstanding votes in GA
There's only about 40k votes left in GA.
I think you’re overestimating the amount of remaking votes. Georgia election official estimated about 48k remaining around 3 pm EST
"I don't think there are 75-100k ballots left to count in GA. I think the number is more like 30k, but I'm not sure that number includes provisionals and military."
40k votes left
"In one of the ~~Trumpy subreddits~~   the screenshot is not from reddit. They're talking about getting their guns and shooting reporters. My bro sent me screenshots.

I think AZ was flipped while Republicans flipped New Hampshire if I'm correct

They will never believe anything unless it says Donny wins. They are completely lost.

"Haha, nice."
It looks like Biden is winning GA.
"Supposedly, there's more than everyone estimated."
The tolls. My god the tolls.
It's a big state.
Philly is 4th largest city and metro is huge. Lots of people in Harrisburg/York/Lancaster triangle. Pittsburgh is another major market probably 25th or so. Allentown and Scranton are also major cities.  And Erie. And it’s a big state.
It has one of the largest cities in the United States
Never been to Philly? (Me neither.)
Philly
Have you been to Philly? It's big dude.
Pretty much Philly and Pittsburgh
They have a few... what do you call them... cities?
Pittsburgh and philly
Philly and Pittsburgh are huge.
"If you drove 80 across the state it’s easy to see how you’d think that, but yeah there are a lot of us"
"Pittsburg and Philadelphia???

It’s a gigantic state, too..."
"The middle of PA is Pennsyltucky, not a lot of people.  Eastern and western PA are where all the people are"
"Because those rural areas exist. Think, every major city is Democrat. Most rural areas are red. It’s packed in cities."
Have you seen the Philly suburbs?
Philly and pittsburgh
"Two very big cities, and despite the small towns being small, there are a lot of them."
"You are aware that Philadelphia and Pittsburg exist, right?"
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh metro areas have more than 8M people combined.
Pittsburgh and Philly are quite large.
Philadelphia my dude.
That's the center.

Care to explain why you think this? I personally think Biden is the only one
"I was unhappy about Biden when he first won the primaries - I thought he'd turn off progressive voters too much - but when I think about it, I'm not sure any other candidate could've bridged the gaps between all wings of the Democratic party + Independents. I don't know what we're gonna do next time."
Also AZ for Biden.
But my adrenal glands...
dibs!
Well I mean the networks can't call or for biden while trump still holds the lead
Happy cake day!

"lmao, I miss normal crazy conspiracy theories like this"
Pennsylvania just needs to finish counting.
But why would NV care about that?
Why would Nevada care about the networks' calls?
I blame the mafia.  Longer process betting lines can be moved
This is what iv been thinking. Let PA and GA decide.
Nevada is absolutely playing games.
"Doubtful. Probably just a mix of a little bit of incompetence, lack of resources (manpower), and poor management."
Don't worry about Nevada. [See](https://twitter.com/EmmaKinery/status/1324463595615330304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1324463595615330304%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ffivethirtyeight.com%2Flive-blog%2F2020-election-results-coverage%2F)
My theory is that they are so incompetent that they don't want to be the state that calls the election because they will get scrutinized into oblivion and it will become public how poorly organized they are
It's almost like gigantic gambling operations run out of Nevada... They have a vested interest in delaying a final result as much as possible.
"Agreed, they don't even have 2 million votes and they're somehow unable to count within 3 days. Ridiculous"
Everyone drove to Vegas or reno to place some fixed bets obviously
"Or to avoid a different sort of attention, lol"
Nevada does have Las Vegas so of course they want all the attention.
Probably will receive mail ins for days
"Right, but the ones being counted are only ones they had by Election Day ( that includes what they say they have left). They will then probably count the ones they receive by Friday next week or over the weekend.   They are allowed until Friday, but if it gets challenged, again, I think they are covering their ass.  So if Biden takes the lead with “what is left” chances are the extra mail in ballots won’t matter."
in prison??
"But after it finally is, he can finally serve his jail term."
Through the reverse power of alchemy I've already lived through it. You can't imagine what Trump will do to Alaska. A land bridge to Russia to exchange bears and Trump-quality meth.
Couldn't find his laptop to write the concession.

So the good kind of nervous?

That's literally the whole point.
Here's hoping
Why? Do you think Trump did something illegal?
Why would you be nervous about the ideal outcome?
Too early
"Hard pass. Trump is already considering running in 2024 and the American people are bat shit crazy about ""socialism"". We need a younger moderate democrat to appeal to a wider audience and stop him from ever getting back in"
No.
"Ha no. A progressive does not win AZ, GA, WI, MI, FL, NC, or NV."
The debates certainly would be fun

But for some reason it's a lot slower updating than AP!
This is awesome. Thanks for sharing.
Is it though?  It seems very unclear.

no.
Oh yeah the sell out who will change his policy positions to the highest bidder. No thanks.

Trump did McCain dirty.   I don't think they are going to forgive him for it.
"Yes and on top of that he is very likely to take AZ and NV

As I said elsewhere, it’s over"

"i did some similar math for arizona and nevada and biden would win them by 70k and 20k votes respectively, if the county-level splits hold"
"No, biden will win ga by 5k"
How is that?  Wasserman is saying if it's 62% the rest of the way then it's dead even
Would like to see your math. He needs 60% to win GA and has been averaging 70%
"Allegedly the mail in ballots in Georgia have been bluer than the county results in Republican districts. Then we still have provisional ballots allegedly. It's gonna be close, like <5000 close I think. A Biden loss by 6000 is probably the worst case scenario"
You were wrong.

Spicy only not the regular
Unreal sandwich.
"It really is, just make sure you get the spicy one!"
The spicy one is good. Pro tip: get some sweet heat dip to go with it.
Nah. Was overblown.
Honestly fam yes
Yep
"I didn't care for it, the texture of the breading was dissapointing, otherwise it was fine"
It’s pretty good
It’s ok. I don’t really think it’s anything special though.
"Its solid, i won't tell you not to get one"
Dude. Yes. I waa a skeptic but it transcends any other chicken sandwich. It is like TV commercial crispy
It’s not that good. Better than most but nothing to write home about
Does a bear shit in the woods
"It’s good. Didn’t warrant the freak out but that was really clever marketing.

Doesn’t deserve Chik Fil A comparisons. They’re different animals*

*both chicken though."
Fuck yeah
I was disappointed honestly. I could make a better sandwich at home. I can’t believe people wait in their ridiculously long drive thru for a something that’s on par with a mc chicken
Its pretty meh. If I really want one Light mayo and extra pickles is how I usually ask for it. And extra pickles on the spicy one.
He won't concede. But I would love to be a fly on the wall if they call it in Biden's favor.
Oh honey. Were never gonna get a concession speech.
One of those might happen.
Trump will never concede lol.
You're not getting a concession speech.
"Not a chance, unfortunately. I don't think Trump will concede period."
"Trump won't give a concession speech. He'll give a ""fraud! This will take months to figure out in the courts""... Rile up his base and piss off the democrats until the very end."
No way is Trump going to concede lol. A Biden victory speech will be certain once everything is confirmed.
“It’s the left.”
They're only reporting once a day each day at 9pm EST
Nevada is just not reporting sadly. Not till tomorrow
They are working like one shift a day and are only providing updates once a day.
"Yep, seems like they’re counting until noon their time each day."
"Dunno if this is accurate but I heard on CNN around 330EST that they were “done for the evening”

Wtf"
I read they were dropping the next count tomorrow
"nytimes.com - hoovering over Nev, it says that they will report Friday. You can see other statuses for the other states too."
It would be over.
"Blackout drunk, but in celebration."
Not refreshing these threads for 72 hours
Stopping on thread 10
President-elect Biden.
This whole thing would’ve ended much quicker :)
Definitely not in thread 47
Nevada could stop counting like they had planned to already
Not worrying about any of this today or yesterday.
Joe would have won
Finished
Celebrating one would assume.
Maybe Democrats finally learned that hispanic voters don't automatically vote Democrat.
White and Reed. Tate has gotten separation but Jones hasn’t prioritized him in the passing game. Matchup good for White.
Oof tate and reed i guess

Tate and White

"Never trust reed coming off an injury, man is frailer than my grandma"
Bro what sort of turmoil is your team going through that you’re resorting to starting them??
Iffy choices but I'd def play Reed and probably White
Is Reed back this week?
"Jesus, what are you playing, a 2015 league? But I'd say Reed and Tate. You can't trust the Patriots to run the ball with White."
Tate and Reed
Reed and White
Not tate. He is unhappy with his role and the giants were trying to move him at the deadline
Reed and Tate
No info. Chill out. Should hear something in a few hours
Lead is holding in Arizona. Looks like Biden will win it.
Biden is going to win PA so he doesn’t even need AZ.
Thanks to PA I’m not freaking about anything. Biden gets PA this thing is done.
It is close. Not freaking out because PA is a lock for Biden and Nevada is a nice cushion above 270.
"Fox, AP, and USA still have it called for Biden."
"Nah, as more votes from PA come in it’s looking more and more likely that Biden is gonna carry it, meaning AZ will be moot."
"No, don’t think so. AP and FOX have not undone their calls for the state"
Apparently the way its supposed to go is really tighten today based on the votes being counted and then tomorrow separate again in Biden’s favor.
"If Biden wins PA, AZ will not matter as it will be over."
AZ is irrelevant at this point even if Trump somehow wins it. The last votes in NV to be tallied come from a primarily D county.
Pretty sure we got this!
Stop fraking about AZ.
"Been watching the news, there hasn't been an update recently. No concern yet but people are talking a lot about GA and PA. PA possibly being finished counting votes tonight."

if trends hold he flips it
"Easily yes. Unless the ballots coming in heavily skew trump, Biden is taking it."
Yeah he can
If the current numbers hold up he should take it. Way too close to call though earlier today there were reports that the final call should be determined by tonight.
"He can, we will likely have to wait to see how overseas military votes affect things."
Yeah
I think the only path Democrats have at taking the senate is somehow winning the GA run offs. Beyond that wait and hope that the midterms are a better showing.
Not necessarily true but its slim chances
There still ballots coming in until the 12th of november. There's a 7k margin. Could be close!
It's unreal that the Senate race might have been lost because Cal Cunningham had an affair.

I haven’t thought of him in years since last night when someone brought up his twitter
[Let's see what he thinks!](https://twitter.com/nero)
"Maybe check his twitter account? See what he's up to.

https://twitter.com/yiannopoulos"
I used to follow Conservative media rather heavily and I honestly have no idea what the fuck he is up to. He basically got deplatformed and even fired from fucking Breitbart lol. After that he tried to launch a podcast with a subscription model that failed pretty miserably.
Yeah he just tweeted. -> https://twitter.com/nero

Don Jr’s offence? He wanted to go to an Yankees game in a Yankees jersey rather than a suit."
He’s an abusive narcissist. To see how he raised him you only have to look at the behavior of his kids. They show us more than anything who trump is.
Everything he does is transactional. I guarantee the same is true with his kids.
pieces on the chessboard for him
"Definitely not. I don't think he loves anything, he is so damaged by the way he was raised and if he wasn't responsible for so much damage, he would be a tragic figure. Imagine spending your entire life without loving or helping anything other than yourself."
I find myself wondering that a lot too
I think he loves them in the way hes capable of loving.  He hooked his family the fuck up
Are you serious
In a rally before the election theres an awkward moment where Don Jr. goes into hug his dad and Trump doesnt flinch so he just awkwardly and almost sadly walks off to the side.

from jail?
I don’t think he can run for office when in prison.
It’s...almost a comment?
Impeached? He should be arrested.
To what end? They would bail him out again
He's already impeached
Sadly no. I think the gop would let trump tanks run over people in dem cities if he wanted
I did what I could do.... I voted blue.
Trump has to get 65% of the remaining votes. Its Biden's.
"Are we doing this shit Spirit Bomb style? 

Take mine too!"
Could do. The AP will. Although the margin in GA is going to be quite small either way and provisionals are a wild card so they will probably wait for PA.
they might not call it? or maybe this is their way of getting back at him for all his shit haha

Everyone losing their shit.
I'm tuning out of this. Just woke up in Australia thinking we'd know by now but you know what? Any result will be contested and likely go to the supreme Court so there's a long ways to go. I've gotten tired of being glued to the screen. Better get on with my life. I have no control over this.
He hasn’t tweeted in 4 hours
"No, everyone didn’t"
People thought that....? Lmfao
No? Lol
"that's a good point. Everyone was so up in arms he was going to run as an independent wearing a MAGA hat purely to steal votes. But then he couldn't get any traction to be put on ballots, gave up, and moved on with his life."
Literally no one thought that.
"Sadly, 50K votes means that Kayne was.

So were the Libertarian candidates. States are being decided by the 3rd party."
"no one did, people just called him out on the publicity stubt"
Ice Clown for Labor Sec.
They will call PA when Biden pulls ahead
"Although it's obvious, they aren't going to call PA until it flips to Biden. They aren't calling NV because they called AZ too early."
Sounds like they easily could. PA looming like a 100k+ biden win and I think most of the outstanding NV vote is mail in from democratic Clark county
All my homies love Asians
Yang 2024 plz
Asian people love golf
And their food is awesome.
Yes
It’s more than likely at this point
Mathematically Biden will win 100%
Yeah
It's borderline callable. There's a reason Trump is scrambling.
"Trump is up 90k votes in PA

Estimated votes remaining are mail-ins from dem areas (\~430k votes)

Biden needs to pull \~60% of those votes to overtake Trump

Biden is averaging \~72-73% of the mail-ins currently"
"Mate...people ate corpses at Stalingrad, they fought brutal house to house combat.

Its bad, but its not that bad, not by a longshot"
Don't.
We'd want to look at their recount record though. Like in WI they said bring it you'll see how good we did like last time. In 2016 in WI Trump only gained a little over a hundred votes in the recount. If Georgia is that good we don't have to worry.
"Yes, but unless the difference is less than 1 000 votes, it's so unlikely the result will change that it's really a waste of money. But, if Trump wants to throw his money at lawyers just to be told he still lost, let him."
It can be projected. That will be enough to piss Trump off more.
"Even if Biden wins GA, with AZ up in the air its not set.  PA would put him SOLIDLY over"
"CNN is the source of that number? The math doesn't add up, it should be over 400k votes"
Where are you getting 77%? It’d be ~64% that Biden would need to pull marginally ahead of Trump in PA.
"No, about 60%.

He's been getting about 70."
"No, he needs to win 64-65% of the remaining ballots. Today he has been winning 78% of the ballots, so it looks good for Biden."
Your math is off
"64%

326x - 326(1-x) = 90

Multiply -326 thru parentheses.

326x - 326 + 326x = 90

Combine like terms and add 326 to both sides. 

652x = 416

Divide both sides by 652.

64%

Edit: added steps"
Wow. That’s worrisome
Almost all of those ballots are mail in ballots from Philly
He’s got it. The margins have been like 80-20 Biden. It’s nearly in the bag.
"63.8% 

Not sure where you are getting 77%"
Your math is a bit off
"Counted and reported is not the same. There may lie a dump inbetween, hopefully cutting the difference."
Im a little optimistic
there may be thousands of counted but not yet reported results
Votes to be counted does not equal votes to be reported. Relax
That would mean he needs 63% of 326k
your math is off. its more like 66%
I would be shocked if biden wins PA
"King just said that if Biden got 70% of the vote count remaining in PA, he would still beat Trump by 40,000 votes. Biden is picking them up at 78% so far.

As others have said, your math seems to be a bit off. He only needs more like 64%."
"I think you did your math wrong. With the numbers you gave, Biden needs 64% of the remaining ballots."
Ballots counted are not ballots reported. That would imply that 80k votes went 50/50 or into a vacuum. The confusion between these numbers is so pervasive in these threads lol.
He only needs 64% by those numbers? 209k to 117k. That's 64.11% of the total votes where Biden gains 92k more votes than Trump.
"No, only 63.8%.

63.8% of 326 is 208 which is 90 greater than the remaining 118.

Edit: *greater, not great"
"65% is the minimum Biden needs, he is trending much higher today. 70% would leave him up by 40k."
" I have been tallying the additional votes for the past 24 hours and Biden has brought in 74% of them.  With 326k votes left, 64% need to go to Biden for PA to swing blue. We should be fine."
In counties traditionally 85 - 90% Democrat.
"your math is wrong. it is about 64%. What we need is to see that the difference between biden and trump is 90k. So Biden(b)-Trump(t) = 90k and b+t = 326k. Therefore, 2xb=326k+90k. 2b=416. b=208. %b = b/(326)x100 which equals 64%"
"Biden would only need to win by about 64%

326000 x .64 = 208640
326000 x .36 + 90000 = 207360"
He always says that though.

When were the US citizens brainwashed into worshipping  the military as a deity? Did this come after WW2?
"NC has reported every ballot they've received. Now they have to wait until the 12th (or maybe day after) for any other ballots to come in, then they'll count and release"
Biden already won AZ just stop it
">No real changes in NC today, curious if they have to wait for the mail-in deadline to pass before counting the rest?

I believe they're counting as they come in, but only getting 1-2k a day at the moment. I expect Trump's won NC, and 150k or so ballots won't be returned, but NC sent out 1.1M ballots and got back like 950k so I wouldn't expect it called until Next week when the deadline officially hits"
Really worried about AZ. GA is lost.
I wouldn't call az a toss up but it's def in play
"Yeah, I believe they said no updates for NC until the 12th?"
"AZ Biden is leading and Trump is not expected to get enough of the remaining ballots, since they're from a heavy Dem district and also absentee. If Fox called it for Biden you know it's done."
"> NV looks good for Biden early, but the gap isn't that substantial.

It seems that 90% of the remaining votes are from Clark County which is a solid blue county."
Lol you weren't kidding
Hahaha just looked. What a little chode.
it almost sounds like he is putting on that accent
No one knows
They seem to believe they’ll finish enough to call who the state is going for
no
Definitely not
"Probably not, Georgia’s been taking like 2 days to count ~150k votes iirc."
"They are literally still receiving votes till friday.

No it wont happen"
Find out next time on Dragon Ball Z!
I doubt it
No
They said maybe but probably not
No. They probably won’t even be done tomorrow.
Not likely
Probably tomorrow. Maybe Saturday.
How is anyone supposed to give you an answer? We don't know.
"Yes. 

But no.

I mean, maybe."
"We won't need PA to finish. Basically the second Biden jumps in front, the state can be called. Trump isn't gaining votes from the outstanding votes."
No but it's possible they'll count enough to call the race
Sure
Maybe
Doubt it
No
As of this morning they were expected too but i dont know if thats changed
No they won't since the Pittsburgh county with 35k remaining won't count until tomorrow
"The answer is no, but it could get called."
"I don't think they will fully finish because of at least Allegheny (sp?) county, which is on hold for some legal reasons I don't fully understand yet."
"No. There's a legal thing stopping them from counting in the county where Pittsburgh is, but the SOS says it's a relatively small number. We may be at a point where it's called tonight, buy my money says no."
"They won't finish counting every single vote.

But whether it gets called depends on how close itnis after more votes come in tonight."

-Trump, probably"
He wouldn't accept lol.
Doesn't work that way. You have to accept a nomination.
I think most states have rules where the governor has to nominate someone from the same party as the person leaving.
Why would that work?  He'd just say no.  They don't drag you kicking and screaming into the cabinet because a president says to.
"Now that, motherfucker, is some 4D Chess."
oh my god you brilliant bastard. Send it up the chain!
"lol that would be funny, I can't imagine Mitch taking it"
Then fire Mitch from the cabinet.
Obama tried this with a Senator from NH I think and he didn’t bite.
Why would Mitch accept that lol
"I mean, you can't nominate the unwilling, and there is no cabinet position that he would take over a new six-year term with a good chance that at least the first two years will be as majority leader."
Give him a position that doesn't really do anything?  Or just CREATE a position that doesn't do anything.
Then fire him for the shit he pulled in the Senate <\_<
Not Mitch but some top non-Trumpy Senators about to retire in 2022. This could work.

"If the Senate doesn't pan out for the democrats, the next two years are likely exclusively going to involve a massive rebuilding of the federal government. 

I think the Republicans will be on the defensive in the midterms, but we may likely see extreme radicalization during gop primaries (as in, worse than usual) if Mitch doesn't negotiate with democrats. If that happens, I suspect we'll end up in a more volatile situation than even now."

It can't. There's only two candidates.

impossible in a runoff who ever gets the most votes wins. there's only two people by design so someone will get more than 50%.

700k ballots to count still."
Pretty good tbh
"Trump's lead continues to shrink, with plenty of votes left to count."
It’s a second election with only two people running against each other
The top two candidates face each other in another vote.  In GA senate race if no candidate receives more than 50% then the top two go to a runoff election.  In principle it should reduce spoilers.  It's a slower shittier way of doing ranked choice voting.
"Rule saying if no candidate gets over a certain percentage, I think 50%, another election is held in January."
"If nobody gets over %50, they do the election for that state again starting in January"
"In georgia, the candidate must receive at least 50 percent of the vote.  Thus they take the top two candidates and put them against each other again.

Edit: candidate for senate"
"It's when a candidate fails to get the majority of the vote (over 50%), in that case a winner is not announced. Instead, the top 2 finishers will advance to the next election ('run off') to determine the final winner."
"It's a special election that will just be the 2 candidates.  Basically a do over.  GA requires them to get 50% + 1 vote.  Purdue is at 49.99% or whatever, so not enough."
"Another election for that specific race. If nobody get more than 50%, then the top two candidates have a second election so one can get over 50%. This happens in some states due to more than two contestants."
"Its a separate election held in GA if no candidate gets 50% or higher of the vote. GA is one of the few states that require a candidate receive the majority of votes in order to win. When, like in this case, there are more than two candidates and it turns out that none of them reach a majority, the two winningest candidates face off in a runoff election (in this case on 1/5/21) where one is guaranteed to win majority."
"Well, in a senate race, whenever candidates drop below 50%, it automatically goes to a run off.

I'm in Scotland, that's as much as I know."
"If none of the candidates in the race receive 50+percent, then the top two candidates run against each other in a special election.  In Georgia right now, this may affect the Senate races."
Barr is probably more worried about his own neck.
They probably have different criteria for calling states
It's pretty close and Trump is closing the gap there. I believe the remaining votes to be counted are mostly predicted to be Republican by some. Many have been saying AZ was just called too early.
"Fox and AP called Arizona for Biden yesterday, but it came out there were more ballots that needed to be counted than originally thought. They're both doubling down on their original call, but everyone else is waiting until there's a clearer picture."
Polls aren't votes
Because it's still technically possible for Trump to flip it.

"I absolutely do. You see like a 3% decrease in 65+ vote for Trump, which I think is largely due to how impacted the senior community is by Trump. My parents mainly shifted from indifferent to anti-Trump because of his handling of Covid.  


Before Covid, whether it's actually because of him or not, the stock market was booming, unemployment was very low, there wasn't much to actually show people to convince them to go against Trump. The people that actually cared about ethics/morals were already anti-Trump, but the uncertain Republicans or indifferent voters needed something concrete that affected their lives. Covid was in front of them, the death counts are on TV every day, the lies are projected on the news every day.   


I think Covid ironically saved the country politically."

320-330k maybe more because ballots are still coming in.
This is absolutely going to be must-watch tv. I’m horrified to see what he’s going to say and how much chaos he’ll attempt to sow.
Trump is probably going to use that time to try and take the nation hostage.

Yup

Nothing. Biden gave a good speech. Trump is giving a speech in 30
"""please be patient; we aren't done yet'"
Trump is pregnant
[deleted]
Tomorrow
Just slow
"A very slow process, with some unexpected delays."
"The judges threw out both of the Trump 'stop counting' court challenges.

Trump = loser x 2"
"Lawsuits haven't done much at all. Counting is just slow, especially for mail ballots."
"The only success Trump got was to have some of his staff observe counting in PA. That slowed things up a little.

All the remaining states that have a chance to go Biden are still chugging along, with no major changes in ratios. Which means there's good odds of winning AZ, NV, GA, and PA."
It's just a slow process from here on out. Mail in ballots are great but it takes time for the folks who couldn't send theirs in until election day and the USPS isn't exactly doing great right now. Add on top that this election is close so they want to be as accurate as possible the first time and not get stuck in court with all of Trump's bullshit.
"It's just slow. All states r still counting, but we only look at the ones still relevant to the outcome, so it looks like a few states r dragging their feet when they're not. It will come slow, but we don't really know which state will dump how many votes and when. We could take Georgia tonight. https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html shows the percentages needed to flip the states, and biden is significantly overperforming those numbers for Georgia at 99.5% reporting"
i really hope so
"I would guess

Twitter always has him live if you can’t find it on YouTube
"Nuclear, Covfefe, hamberder. FRAUD! LOCK HER UP! ODMNRHGSMNE+"
"Either rant and stoke anger and/or violence or make it very short and knowingly say ""Don't worry guys, we have this. They are cheating, and we will get them. After all the LEGAL votes are counted, we will come out on top."""
probably won’t be calls in some states until at least tomorrow
It's amazing right? What are these people doing...
Trump is speaking in 30 mins and PA has a 78K gap now
You must not be in America because it's mid-afternoon/evening in the states. You just woke up from last night? lol
"Oh, I doubt it. He's multinational, and Trump isn't totally in line with his unabated capitalist vision of the world. He'll be fine.

The true hope is that he'll die and his kids will not continue his media in its current form. Someone will, of course, but the death of the FOX News brand in the US would go a long way."

yes
Yes
yep
"Correct. 
35k"
"35k, I believe."
" Yes, in the next few days. No one is really sure why they are not counting today."
They’ve said since before the election that it would take at least until Friday. We’ll actually be lucky if we know for sure tomorrow.
Correct
"I think that's correct, there's a special meeting that has to happen before they can count those votes for some very logical reason (I presume).

Still, that 30k shouldn't make a huge dent in what's looking like a decisive win for Biden in PA."
I do not understand how he's even coherent let alone able to stand up and move his arms and stuff lol.

I beg to differ from my experience hahaha
They are moving on to other stories.. lol
What website is that?
It means we have a big fight on our hands.
"Without Trump on the ballot, Republican voters may not show as strong as usual"
"It's a pretty even split. I live here and it's intense. We'll find out who takes both races in January! Ossoff and Warnock are both awesome candidates, and we're doing our best to keep people engaged and motivated"
"That would mean that only the D & R candidates run and that the 3rd party supporters have to either not vote or vote for them, in which case I'm thinking they'd vote D.

I think."
"Truthfully, it's still a long shot. But two runoffs in GA denies the GOP a majority for a bit longer and gives hope that Dems *might* be able to get a 50-50 split (unlikely)."
best case scenario we might end up with Warnock (D) and Purdue (R). I'm not sure if Osoff can beat Purdue in a straight head to head outside of the primary. Warnock though. He did really well and has a real chance.
"Ossoff getting another crack at it when he closed a lead and was campaining well could net him the seat. Kinda doubt they'd take the other one though, the Republicans split each other's votes.

Hard to say though, a lot can happen in two months. Trump kicking off major civil unrest or Mitch sitting on a stimulus package until the new year while people are struggling could hurt them badly.

Gut feeling if it goes to a runoff, they take one of them and its a 49-51 split with Biden spending the first two years of his term trying to make nice with Mitt Romney."
"I have talked about this a lot, you can look at my history. Looks like both of our seats will be runoffs. Obviously turnout usually swings Republican. BUT, getting those seats would make the Senate 50-50 (VP breaks a tie). So the Senate majority and our ability to do fucking anything as a country hinges on these seats.

The enthusiasm, money, and turnout here in Georgia is going to be insane - especially if we flip blue for Biden.

"Highlights were:

""If you count the legal votes I won handily""

""Detroit, Atlanta are known for corruption""

""Tremendous lawsuits are coming, might go to the highest court in the land""

""Mail in voting is extremely corrupt""

He basically called for a coup."
"Basically ""WAAAWAAA I WAS WINNING BEFORE THE CORRUPT DEMOCRATS STARTED DOING FUNNY THINGS, WE'RE GOING TO COURT!!!"""
"It was essentially him complaining about how he *was* winning, but now he's **not** winning, so he thinks it's a giant conspiracy. He presented zero evidence, but he of course claimed he had Yuuge amounts of evidence, and that he's going to win lots of court cases, and bla bla bla... it really wasn't anything more than him whining about losing, without admitting he's losing."
"-Mail in voting corrupt people who weren’t originally corrupt.

-Democrats are dishonestly stealing this election.

-Votes are being fabricated and being made after voting day.

-I won (insert state here) but then these “magical” Democrat votes came in and now I might win by a little bit or even be losing by a little bit.

As long as GA keeps going the Dem way the Republican will stay under 50%. Republicans are getting 2 more in Alaska and NC most likely so it'll be 48-50 and then those 2 GA races will go to a runoff in January
There are the 2 in Georgia that look like they're gonna be a runoff. Then there's the one in North Carolina which is trending (+2.1%) toward Thom Tillis (R) but won't have more info on for a while. Then there's the one in Alaska that seems almost certainly to go to  Dan Sullivan (R)

Nobody is fearmongering when Don Jr less than an hour says Donal Trump needs “to go to total war over this election “.
"Ha, watch for yourself. You have a lot more trust in him than I do."
We'll have to see how she does.

4 years is a long time. Think about the 4 you just lived through.
"Four years is a long time if a Biden administration is popular, but also depends highly on who she runs against."
Well I mean Biden will also be running? Why does everyone think Biden’s going to croak? Such a weird sentiment.
A lot of people never saw Trump winning. You never know until you know.
Me neither. I see Pete Buttigieg vs Nicki Haley in 2024.
No way.
"Yeah, this election is looking like a Democratic victory, but it suggests that they need to do some serious work to connect with voters. This kind of performance isn't going to cut it nationally in '24."
"Yeah yeah, we said the same thing about Biden less than a year ago."
"Me neither. If you could, Who would be your pick ?"
Maybe with a good vp pick and 4 years of things going smooth and good. Whatever trump does in lame duck session might also kill off a bit more republican support
"She might; It depends who she is against... I dont know who in the Rep party can run now and generate the same enthusiasm. If Trump runs again, then no. But by then trump will be like 80 something and have 4 years of eating ice cream on the couch re-watching all this rallies, remembering the good ole days."
Hopefully we have someone that actually knows what the hell they’re doing by then
"She should not run. I think there was a poll conducted and I believe she got around 20-ish percent support. 

The best ticket, imo, would be Duckworth/Moulton. A double vet ticket (plus that ticket would strike the right balance between a supposed moderate with Duckworth and a progressive like Moulton)."
"Depends on what happens. Trump only lost cause of a virus honestly, I think he would have sent those last checks he might have won."
I wonder who will be the DNC front runner if Trump wins this one. If Biden wins I’d bet Haley for the GOP 2024.

Oh man... very formative celebrity crush for me.
They have not all finished. They just got called because of strong leads either way.
"Because you’re wrong. It’s simply because you haven’t been following the count in other states. 

California has only counted 66%. DC 80%, Jersey 71%. 

Counts have historically taken a few days to tabulate."
They might just be trying to be extra damn sure since any one of them decides the election right now (unless Arizona doesnt count yet)
Other states aren’t as close so you can project the winner with less of the total
These are absentee ballots which could not be processed before the election because... these states are stupid.
"These are mail in ballots. Some state legislators (Republicans) blocked these states from allowing them from processing them prior to election day like other states. Removing them from envelopes, checking the signatures, addresses postmarked date etc. It takes forever to do manual counts and security checks. Apparently there are also observers and challengers from each party there to oversee and question individual ballots. If there are questions about individual ballots they go to an adjudicator in a different building."
"Pssst, the other states haven't finished either. There was just enough of a lead that they could reasonably call the race."
"You know what scaled operations are, right? Like, am I going to keep 50k people around to count 1 vote each so you can have your count in the next second?"
It’s all mail-in ballots that have to be checked by hand
Please let this be right
You sure about that math?

There is no logic to the electoral college that isn't racist
Also because if a state votes as a monolith they’re disenfranchising their own voters by keeping the electoral college unless it’s a swing state. New York is chock full of republicans outside of cities and some suburbs. But their presidential vote counts for nothing. And yet they’re fine with it as long as the electoral college allowed somebody in Alabama to vote for what they like. It’s almost sad
"> There is some logic to the electorial college, so I'm not outright blasting it, but the argument against abolishing it I keep hearing is ""why should high population cities control the elections?!""

It's because that argument is total bullshit and the people making it haven't done ***any*** research. 

Yes, some of the most populous cities are in New York and California. 

But it shrinks down ***incredibly fast*** after that. 

19# Denver, Colorado	727,211

28# Memphis,	Tennessee	651,073

40# Omaha,	 Nebraska	478,192

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population

When you do a popular vote for President, everyone's vote counts equally. More importantly, it pulls the importance ***off*** of swing states and makes candidates have to compete for ***every vote***. 

This would force Republicans to the left and would hopefully result in less insane candidates."
APA called Arizona. They are never wrong (the vast majority of the time anyway.) Georgia or Nevada is not confirmed entirely yet but if he picks up either state then it’s a wrap.
Except Nevada doesn’t look like it’s a lock just yet
"I don't think GA is going to be 100% confirmed anytime soon. The vote is probably too close there for someone to clearly win it when they're done counting. Arizona could be the same, but we have no real idea until a lot more are counted."
AZ is confirmed.
They're not black

Yes
Yep
Arizona
Yup
Yes
Yes
Yes. AP and Fox have called it
"Yes, Fox and a few others called AZ to Biden early yesterday."
Yes it is
yup
Yes
Fox gave AZ to Biden early
Yes they and ap are the only ones who called az
Yup!
Fox News and AP are the only places that have called Arizona
Yes.
AZ
Yes. FOX and AP are calling AZ for Biden
Most outlets havent called Arizona yet
"Fox called Arizona Tuesday night, other outlets have not done so"
Arizona.
Yes
"Yep, they now counting Arizona in the other outlets"
Yep
Yes
"Yes, fox called AZ for Biden like Tuesday night, early Wednesday I believe"
Yeah they called AZ for Biden way too early
Yea. Fox and AP are the only ones who've called Arizona.
Yeah Fox is counting AZ but most others arnt.
"Yes, Fox and AP called Arizona on election night."
"Yeah, Fox called AZ for Biden when other sources haven’t yet!"
Thats my assumption. 253 cause Ar may or may not stay with Biden.
Fox called AZ earlier than anyone and has refused to retract it.
AZ
the Fox News tracker is counting Arizona as a Biden win. most other media outlets aren't
"Yes, it's counting AZ."
Because they called Arizona for Biden.
Yes
Yes AP and Fox called Arizona quite a while ago
jep fox and ap called Az
They called Arizona along with AP on election night
Fox News called Arizona very late Tueday night/ Wendsday morning.  Some say they jumped the gun.
"Yeah Fox called Arizona for Biden early, yesterday I believe. Reports say Trump called Fox mad as hell about it.

People think Arizona could still flip to Trump so we'll see what happens with that"
Fox and AP have called Arizona for Biden whereas other media outlets think it's still too close to call.
"Fox called AZ for Biden on Tuesday. Most other media outlets still have the state as ""Too close to call."""
Correct. Fox has called AZ for Biden (along with AP). But cnn and nyt hasn’t yet
Fox called Arizona for Biden yesterday morning
"Yeah, Fox called AZ for Biden. AFAIK, they’re the only ones that have done so"
"Fox, NPR, AP, and others have called AZ for Biden since yesterday, MSNBC and other news outlets have not."
"Yup. Fox called Arizona, others like CNN havent. AZ is worth 11."
Yes
Fox and AP have already called AZ
Yup they count Az. They didn’t walk it back
"It is. Only Fox and AP have called Arizona for Biden, but it's still technically in play and could flip. Emphasis on could, since we have no real information to go off of"
They are counting Arizona.
"Yes, Fox called Arizona but no other station has."
Yes. Fox is standing by its projection.
Fox and the AP called AZ for Biden before anyone else. I’m as shocked as you are.
Yea
"Yes, AP called AZ for Biden on Wednesday and that is who FOX is pulling their tracking info from."
Yes
Fox and AP called Arizona a few days ago and won't budge.
Yeah Fox has declared Arizona while others haven’t
Yeah
Yes they are counting Arizona
"Yes, Fox is including AZ for Biden but most other outlets are more conservative in making that call since there are many votes left. However, I wouldn't be surprised if the lead holds."
"Yes,  Arizona. Media outlets are bound to just a handful of different sources and some have called Arizona and some haven't."
Fox and a few others called Arizona early
"Correct. Only some outlets have called Arizona for Biden. Personally, I don't think AZ should be called yet. Still confident it will be Biden, but there is enough uncertainty with what votes and what counties are left as far as votes still to count that it probably shouldn't be called.

Right now PA and GA are the key counts to watch. PA makes it a clear win. GA means Biden would still need NV if Arizona does in fact flip to Trump."
"Fox News and AP both called ARI, much to the unhappiness of trump.  Fox esp was very early with the call, so NYT, CNN, NBC, CBS, ABC etc have not made the call.  Doesn't mean it won't happen, they just don't have the data to make the call, in their opinion."
"Yes, Fox and AP both called AZ early so that accounts for the 264 VS 253."
"Fox (along with the AP) called Arizona for Biden very early, bizarrely. The moldy cheeto was very upset by this, of course.

The other major networks have not called Arizona."
They called Arizona early. Probably regretting it now that Nevada is pretty much callable (NV+AZ = Biden at this point).
I hate when shows I've invested so much time into get cancelled before their finale.

I agree with this.
Story of my life for the past 4 years...
Oh I can't wait. He's losing it. Figuratively. Literally. Numerically.
hasn’t he been ahead of schedule so far?
"It was cumberland county though, which is heavily reupublican so the fact he gained there at all is good news. The bulk of philly still has to report and he's been getting upwards of 80%. Also, I think 66% is all he needs, but barely."
That was the last of Harrisburg's suburbs coming in. The real meat is in Allegheny County/Philly metro
That's not far off from what we've been seeing all day. Statistical anomaly - if it continues to happen it'll be a trend.
"Depends on where it was from really, if Biden is pulling 65% in pro Trump areas that is awesome."
he needs 59.92% according to this: https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html
That vote was cumberland county (a Trump +10% county).  It was +18% Trump county last time.  So Biden is up 8% from Clinton margins.
"The latest batch ws from a mildly red area, Cumberland County, so it's pretty good considering that I think."
"True, but from what I understand, those votes are largely from GOP areas, and nothing from Philly."
[removed]
Biden only needs 59% at this point of future ballots
Where are you getting your numbers because everything I’ve seen is showing that he needs around 60% from here on out.
He needs 60%.
Biden needs 59.92% of the remaining vote. He’s doing just fine.
asking the same
Biden is down to getting 66% of the vote and he needs 59% now.
66 Biden 33 Trump
Trump 33.7% / 66.3% Biden

The military won’t do it. We signed an oath to support and defend the constitution and obey lawful orders.

"To do what?

The military is American citizens, they wouldn't take that order and 25A would get done real quick."
"So what? Military's not going to prevent him from losing this election.

Any strongman attempt at this point would be a losing move.

GOP as a whole better bring their best behavior because at the slightest misshap, they might lose the Senate as well in January with the 2 runoffs in Georgia."

"He’s averaging about 70% of mail in votes, which is the majority of what remains.  Every once in a while you see a small county drop a couple hundred votes that are more trump favorable but then you’ll have 10k plus that go 87-12 Biden."

"No. But if you increase the amount of money to an amount that allows me to move country to country at semi-regular intervals, then yes. 

I would calculate how fast snails can move at max speed, and then I would move between houses with plenty of cushion time so the snail couldn't get me. 

Unless of course this snail has a big brain and would be smart enough to hide in one of the houses and trick me. Then fuck that."
"Uh, yah? Put a jar over the snail? Or simply kill it with a stick? Easiest money ever."
"Typical garden snail moves 0.029 mph, so about 0.7 miles a day and 254 miles a year."
"Can it swim? If not, I take the deal and move to a tropical island"
"Nah, that snail is much faster than the people counting these votes, I'd be scared it would catch me."
I like the original better.
I'm not falling for the decoy snail again 🐌
"The vast majority of snails can’t swim, so yes."
Does the snail knows my location at all times even if I hide?
Can I move away from it or is it always an a constant and closing distance.  And how far does it start

No. I'd forget about the snail or accidentally touch it.
Decoy snail.
Can I just hit it with a shovel?
"I notice you did not mention that it is an immortal hyperintelligent snail.

Thus, I pay someone five bucks to kill it."
"My cats would eat the snail long before it would get me, but then I’d probably feel bad and try to save it. Fuck, is this why I’m so poor?"
Yes. You can easily calculate the rate of the snails movement over X amount of distance. Then you have Y amount of time from the point that you measure to do what you want before you have to worry about moving away from it.
I spend five of those dollars on a hamster wheel. Pay someone three dollars to put the snail on it.
"Can I wear gloves? Does it have to touch skin, or just anything I’m wearing? Can I use a pole, or glass box to keep it away from me? Can I kill it with a hammer?"
Only a milli?  For an eternal death snail?
Yes and the immediately go find the snail and rub it over my entire body
"I'd fly to Australia, take the money, fly back to the US. 37 years later when the snail arrives in the US, I'd fly to New York and chill for many years. When the snail gets there, I'd fly to Hawaii. Then I be dead of old age by the time the snail gets there. So good deal."
I'd carefully capture it and mail it to Australia.
Can you.find the snail pick it up with a tool and lock it in a box
A million?  No chance.  A million sounds like way more money than it actually is nowadays.  Make it a billion and I'd take it.
"Sure.  Pay someone $1,000 to pick up the snail, kill it, cook it, an eat it.   Free $999,000 and no more snail.  Problem solved."
"I mean, I guess you'd just have to structure your life so that you spend like 13 hours a day somewhere that is a 12 hour snail walk in the same direction away from your house. I think I could manage that so sure why not!"
"I mean, that sounds like something a hammer would fix.

Wait. How long do snails live? I don't think they're long lived. Does that mean I don't have long to live either?"

Do you mean Arizona?
"Just per betting odds, which aren’t based on the real data."
Not according to that link.
[deleted]
Doesn’t need Nevada if he takes Georgia.
NV is done honestly.  The county with the remaining ballots leans like 90% Democrat
"I thought this too, but if the remaining counts are from Chatham County rather than the Atlanta area, then his odds are a lot lower. 

I’ve decided not to get my hopes up. It was a nice idea."
"Do you know what remains in NV?

Clark County, Hilary won with 52%. Biden has been polling better than her in many places across the country. Even if it’s less, Biden still wins NV."
Or the national to be quite honest
"I think it's possible based on the Fox News polls where it shows the average republican clearly favors progressive causes as long as they are phrased correctly. Most people want government-run healthcare, most people want investments in renewable energy, etc. Those same people do not want ""socialism"" or ""the green new deal"" because that's what they've been told.

Republicans are masters at messaging and democrats severely lack in that area. A lot of progressive values are populist positions, they just have to be messaged correctly."
"random, you coomer."
I would love president Duckworth actually
What? Biden doesn't need it.
Not necessarily. Biden doesn't need it

"Makes sense to me. I've learned to manage it, somewhat, but I perceive my parents' and grandparents' irrational fear and anger in myself, despite having a much less stressful life than any of them did."
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
"You do realize they've done that on purpose? The intention is that they can say ""we have had X complaints on our site"" and they're working to make that x as big as possible. The content of your report isn't what matters, it's the numbers of reports... Any report you send is good for them."
Yeah. It's been over since Tuesday night really in NV. A super uncomfortable lead but it just wasn't shrinking at all.
"For those that aren't familiar with American betting odds, this means you'd have to bet $2900 to win $100.  Trump done."
"Nobody is calling it because calling it would mean calling the election, so they are just waiting for everything to be counted until its beyond all doubt from all angles."
"Every analyst has been saying that for hours, but no one wants to call it because AP and Fox called AZ for Biden so that would end the race if you added up states projected by at least 2 outlets."
Here's to hoping he runs every 4 years as a third party and just starts siphoning votes.
Not if he's imprisoned. Fingers crossed...
Can convicted felons run for president?
Not if Twitter ban him permanently
if the gop wants to prop him up again. they might move on

Can felons become President?
He's either going to be in Russia or prison by then.
How's he going to run for office from jail?
Not after he goes quite literally insane from losing to Sleepy Joe.
Biden is 77
Not unless he ends up in prison.
Ha! I needed a good laugh. This was Trump's best shot. Record turnout for Republicans and he's still on track to lose.
He would never get the nomination after he lost the general
He can't run from jail/Moscow
Not sure they're at parity in terms of health and mental wellness.
"I doubt it, the Trumps are going off on Twitter against the GOP. Even if he doesnt end up in jail, theres no chance he runs as Republican again, and at best splits their ticket with a independent run"
"Trump isn't likely to be as healthy. Obese, poor diet, and now severe covid. Plus likely amphetamine abuse and history of ministrokes.

That he's even going at 74 is a miracle. I'd bet on Bernie healthy enough if Joe doesn't seek a 2nd term before Trump."
Hopefully he will be in jail for something to do with tax evasion by then. Or homeless after not being able to pay back any of his loans.
Lifestyle matters more and more as you age. If he is alive he might not have what it takes.
4 more years of Big Macs may not get him to that point TBH.
"Uhm.. should Biden prevail, I don't think the country will be so quick to jump on the Trump crazy train again.  Once the agitator is gone, I think cooler heads will prevail.  Eventually a chunk of Trump voters will realize that they aren't locked up in re-education camps, and they can still drive cars with gas, and that all of the other outright lies they were told never happened."
"If Trump does lose, I don't think he's gonna be in great shape to run in 4 years. I could see him backing Ivanka though."
shes a good person but i think georgia needs her more for a while as shown with this election how areas are starting to transform
"Just my opinion, but she'd probably be better in Nancy Pelosi's role. She seems to be really good at campaigning and organizing."

"People have been using the threads numbers to represent the presidents. 44th president obama, 45th trump, 46 biden and aoc the 47th."
Because people want her to be the 47th president (after Biden)
I would love Fox to be the first to announce Trump’s loss. What a would we’re living in.
15 minutes
we're all tense -_-
Reddit falls apart when threads get too big.
Drama?
Reddit goes a bit wonky when comments get beyond a certain point
Comment limits
Comment limits get reached.
The two candidates will participate in a 100 meter foot race to determine who gets the senate seat.
senate will go to a runoff election if neither candidates gets above 50% of the vote
"Pretty much a second election, but the only options are the two candidates in the runoff."
"More than two candidates in the running, if someone doesn’t get a full majority they narrow it down and do another election in january"
"It's a race between the top two vote-getters. It's like how there's a ""runoff"" election between Biden and Trump if neither gets to 270 votes."
If no one candidate gets 50% they do a runoff election with the top 2 candidates in January.
"Since neither candidate got 50.1% (assuming, that is, that neither candidate gets 50.1%) in either of the races, it means they have to have another election for that given contest.

So, for example, if it's Ossoff 49%, Perdue 49%, then nobody has 50.1% and the next ballot is JUST those two, no third-parties.

In the Warnock/Loffler/Whats-His-Face (you can tell my GAF level about names, right now) race, it was always headed to a run-off because nobody was gonna get 50% when there were two Dem and two GOP candidates.  Next time around, it's just gonna be the two.

Oh.  And it may just decide control of the Senate.

No biggie."
"If either candidates in the current Senate race in Georgia fail to secure 50% of the votes or more, a run-off election happens in January where they vote again to decide the winner.

And the Georgia special election is going to run-of already between Kelly Loeffler(R) and Raphael Warnock(D).

So Democrats might have two opportunities to take Senate seats from Republicans which would give them the numbers they need in the Senate to take control.

Keep in mind these run-off election currently favor the R candidates based on the total number of Republican voters that voted in the these two races."
Since neither senate candidate got a majority (over 50%) they have a runoff election between them.  I dont know if every state does this
In GA if no one gets more than 50% of the vote the go to a re-vote in Jan
"If neither candidate gets 50% of the vote, it goes to a run-off in early January. Basically another election to determine the winner."
Whoever makes the best brisket wins. Mesquite ftw.
If no one gets 50% they have a special election
Google it

"Tucker Carlson is their front runner, which shows you how far they've fallen."
"As a Democrat who knows very little about this stuff, I've liked Romney more and more as he shit on Trump. But im sure he's considered ""too left"" for Republicans now. They essientally need someone as loud as Trump, but not as stupid."
Ben Sasse. Tom Cotton. Ted Cruz. Paul Ryan. Marco Rubio. Maybe Romney?
Ummm... I'm not going to think about the 2024 race until at least 2022.  I'm a masochist but even I have limits.
"Kanye perhaps, he was friendly with trump and he should get their colored voters back."
Its only 4 years away and he'll have his own TV Channel. He's running again and the GOP can't stop it.
Rubio and Cruz probably or Romney
No clue. But I have a weird suspicion that they are going to go pro-legalization (MJ) to pull younger voters.
"I think guys like Hawley, Cotton, Dan Crenshaw. I don't see the party coming back to the middle with a Romney at this point."
There have been multiple updates today.
Not the presidency
President is simple majority I believe.
"No, just Senate."
No runoff for the presidency.
"No, only for the Senate seats."
No. No runoff for President.
No
Not for Presidenncy.
No
No. Just senate seats.
No
No but there's a possibility of a recount if it's within 1%
No EC is just the most votes
No runoffs for presidency
No
No that doesn’t apply to the presidential race.
"Just for senate, not for president"
Maybe.
Maybe but not as likely as him winning PA
Nah but it's a possibility and would be great if it happened.
Obviously
"I think it’s very possible, maybe even likely."
"Clearly, or they wouldn't have voted for him"
"Yes, they are willing.  They already have by voting for him in this election."
"> Are they will to set their principles aside to support such an abhorrent man?

I think you know the answer to that.  He's been openly talking about his plans for undermining the election for months.  Yes some of his supporters think it's abhorrent.  No they would not vote for Biden as a result."
">Are they will to set their principles aside to support such an abhorrent man?

They set them aside, then burned them, then did it again. They don't have any more principles to set aside. Which is kind of what makes them so scary"
Likely tomorrow
"Gap in PA is 90K gap in GA is 9600. PA SOS says we might know by tonight, GA not sure"
"Still be counted. No timeline yet. 9k behind in GA, 90k behind in PA."
Trumps lead in PA down to 90k votes. His lead in GA down to like 9k. Both continuing to release votes but they're coming in small batches.
"Supposedly more released by days end, Biden is *projected* to lead by at least 100k in PA once votes are counted- but GA is toss up still"
I think Allegheny County is going to tally the final 35000 votes they have tomorrow. I could be wrong on the number but that's what I saw earlier today. Something along the lines of 29k of those were ballots resent to people who initially received the incorrect one.
"PA doing all the heavy lifting, more than likely Biden.

GA maybe aye, maybe no.

We won't find out until stardate 210930."
Nothing berders
"lawsuit filed to stop the count because ""Trump patriots"" weren't allowed to watch the count properly. Hearing set for 5:15pm"
"The SoS is speaking right now, it sounds like they are counting votes quickly, but reporting is where the gap is."
They're still counting.
No they're not.
"No. PA Sec of State is just answering questions. Someone just asked her about 4 year old tweet where she may have criticized Trump before she took office. Seriously. You're missing very little.

326k left to count."
It takes forever for 20 people to open 700000 mail in ballots
He looks like a poor mans anderson cooper
Sitting on your ass watching the internet is so tough
"I've reached political saturation.  I read your post as you were ""going to feel like Tom Hanks after the Obama beach scene...""  

Wait!  What?"
I’m still in the shell-shocked looking around at the gory carnage phase.
I think my Tom Hanks' state of mind will be more like seeing a ship pass by on a raft in the middle of the pacific ocean. I am going to try and scream but I will be exhausted.

If they lose PA it's over
Trump cant win without PA
Trump can’t win without PA. So not sure why you think it doesn’t matter for him.
because if biden wins PA he wins the election period
Trump can’t win without PA. Biden still can.
Trump is toast if he loses any one of them.
"Because if Biden wins PA it’s over for trump, that would put him over."
"Source? 


edit: CNN just said it.


edit2: Holy Shit this is going to be it. He is going to call for a civil war, ain't he?"
Rumor is that he’s announcing that he’s conceding.
Remember stand back and stand by. This is the moment. Trump will have his call to action in this speech. Right wing violence to follow. I would bet a weeks pay on it.
Eeewww
Add on a minimum of 40 min to that time. So maybe by 715 he’ll speak
Nancy Pelosi may try it.  She's feisty these days.
"Fox, social media propaganda, low education amongst 40-70 age group"
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
Ok that's reassuring.
How are you seeing how many votes are counted but not reported... Ive been trying to figure that out
PA has stated that they have counted more than reported. I suspect they are increasing security.
About 100% when trump specifically asks for it at 6:30 eastern time
Contact is also amazing!
Nice stream of consciousness
"News flash, you really don't!"
Dowhatchalike
I would hope the military refuses orders there
He'll invoke Order 66 first.
Not an American. What does that mean?
"Sure there is. 

Don't have 48% of your populace vote for a hateful, racist charlatan after 4 years of him running the country into the ground."
No chance
lol Never. Even if he loses he won't concede
Probably not in the next hour.
never in a million years will he concede
"HIGHLY unlikely, however it would be the best move for him if he wants a life after the presidency"
More likely he calls the proud boys to attack
"yeah, I have a date with Scarlett Johansson"
I actually think that might be one of the more probable outcomes.  Most likely is Biden wins them all.
"Yes its considered proper language to do so, even when no longer president.  Its also why they refer to bjden as vp biden"
"it's like ""My pleasure"" at Chick-fil-a.  


you're contractually obligated to say it."
I'm pretty sure they are supposed to out of respect for any president.
"I mean, you're supposed to as a professional."
He's president until at least Jan 20th.
"So do I, out of respect for the office, plus the fact that using his title highlights the dire situation of him being commander in chief."
"Yes, unfortunately even when he is kicked out of the White House, he will still be referred to as President Trump."
"As far as I'm aware, yes. That's commonplace when talking about sitting Presidents and is even pretty common post-presidency. They still usually refer to Biden as Vice President Biden, but they do just say Biden from time to time, although I'd assume that's because he's not the sitting VP."
It's not a concession speech if that's what you're wondering...
"Trump is going to rant and rave but votes will still be counted.

At this point, it’s inevitable."
"Looking VERY good for Biden. Much of the remaining ballots to be counted are absentee/mail-in, which HEAVILY favors Dems."
">Is it still looking good for Biden or does the orange shit stain speaking at 630pm become something to be concerned about?

Nothing to be concerned about. He's just going to incite rioting and try to launch a second Civil War. You know, his usual stuff."
I mean it's always a bad time hearing him speak about anything
"Biden is still looking good. Plenty left to count in PA, still up in Arizona and Nevada and enough to count in Georgia that it could still flip for him."
"Cumberland, one of the last major pro-Trump hold outs in PA, just went 70% Biden in mail ins.

It'll take a miracle/disaster for Trump to win Pennsylvania now."
His speaking changes nothing.
"He's probably going to claim he won, haha."
It's still looking good for biden.
"Come on, be civil

Feces doesn't deserve to be compared to tRump."
">Is it still looking good for Biden or does the orange shit stain speaking at 630pm become something to be concerned about?

Yes, I am afraid sh!t will start to happen afterwards"
Biden is still looking good.
Incoming FUD at 630pm. He's going to try to stir things up.
Will throw one
">might

?

Nah expect it."
"Might? He's a narcissist with neurological degeneration. He is already, and will continue to because he can't stand losing to begin with and has the self control of an old man screaming at nurses."
I expect him to do that.
"I was, like, whatever the opposite of a power washer is."
"Lol may be too much info, but I was backed up for a week and now it's nothing but nervous shits the last 2 days"

Calling PA for Biden sounds insane right now just because he's down

"I watched her speak on CNN last night.

Thoroughly unimpressive."
Yes
Biden WILL win Pennsylvania. The mail in ballots are breaking his way overwhelmingly and they'll be more than enough to push him to a massive lead.
Have you been in a coma
Very
Very likely
yes
Hes going to by over 100k votes
He's getting there!
Yes. He's trending well with every count being reported
Yes it is in progress
its a mathematical fact
Can? Definitely. Will? Still up in the air.
"Not only could, but should - and by a margin larger than WI, and about on par with MI."
Yes but it's no guarantee at all.
Very
Looks like it.
Not just can... is probably going to win by a good margin.
True and likely.
"The gap is closing and philly votes are still being counted, in other words: oh yeah."
"Not only is it true- it's likely. He needs to avg. approx. 59.9% of the remaing votes, and hes been avg. 66.3% of those."
Right now it looks like he will convincingly.
Yep. Gaps been narrowing constantly with no signs of stopping before the votes are all in.
"Hopefully, YES!"
Yes. If he gets more votes.
"All projections point to this, currently. By a margin high enough to avoid recount, too."
It actually looks likely. The remaining votes have been going to him at an 80% clip
"Eh, it'll do"
Bernie is one of my heroes. He inspired so many people. He should of been president but his impact will be felt for the rest of time because of who he was and what he did. I dont give a shit what people say about Bernie Sanders he is a American icon who is way more important than Donald Trump or Joe Biden.
Or maybe people like him and you’re personally an outlier.
False
"nah I doubt it, even though I supported Bernie, I don't think many moderate conservatives in Georgia/Arizona/Pennsylvania and Michigan would have voted for Sanders."
"I think we all know that. Each election has its own context and each candidate does too. This one the context was democracy vs trump, therefore uniting the left and parts of center and some right wing"
We'll deal with that after we cut Trump off of our country like the cancerous tumor it is.
Jesus enough boohoo Bernie crap
"Explain to me how Bernie's inability to obtain a majority of votes in the primary is somehow ""the establishment"" preventing him from winning and not his own failure?"
Ehhh I am a pretty die hard Bernie fan and I see this more as the power of the Republican propaganda machine in action. I mean if they convinced some folks that Biden was a socialist than they would have their voters thinking Bernie was the 2nd coming of Stalin/Mao which may have incited even more votes. Dems certainly aren't perfect but we are dealing with an unprecedented amount of fake stupid shit being shared amongst people. Young folks grew up learning about the dangers of the internet whereas older folks just like and share whatever agrees with their preconceived notions no matter how whacked out they may be.
I’d argue Biden is the only candidate in the line up who could win. He has huge support with black voters and they are the reason Biden won MI and WI and is looking to win PA and GA.
"I get what you’re saying and I agree that for myself Bernie was by far the better candidate, but what the dems needed to do was flip back the blue wall and independent voters in those states just weren’t going to favor Bernie over trump. Biden they can trust, but people in those states have bought into the socialist fear mongering. Biden was the right choice. 
The next election could be rough."
"I think this is a line of thinking that should absolutely be considered to avoid getting cocky. 100% absolutely. It may have been the major deciding factor.

&#x200B;

However, it is one of a lot of potential factors and it is completely unknown which one is the magic bullet. For all we know Bernie would have underperformed in (insert close race here). Biden has long been considered palatable in the rust belt, which could be the only reason he's winning. Maybe it completely is irrelevant. I'm rambling I just disagree with the person who said false while also disagreeing with how sure you are."
Bahahaha Bernie would have been destroyed. Look at how Trump mobilized his voting block. Fear of the commie socialists that are going to steal the equity in their 150k home. Bernie would have been blown out my dude
"Lol Bernie would’ve been absolutely rolled. You can see how alive McCarthyist fear of communism and socialism is in the US, right? I think there would be more of a swing to Trump from undecided voters to prevent Bernie from getting in, let alone a swing to Bernie. Bernie can get young idealistic people talking about him on the internet, but as we saw in the primaries, he can’t get them to vote."
"What'd you *say*, *chief*?"
I wonder if trump sets up a number of home alone style traps in the oval office
"I really needed this laugh.... honestly, if he mumbled the declaration of independence for the next 4 years (and let experts do THIER JOBs!!!) - I'm cool with that."
They're probably happy considering the GOP resurgence in So Cal

"Named after William Penn, who was granted the land by the King of England. It translates to 'Penn's woods'"
are you not american?
I live here.  AMA.
"> Pennsylvania

""Penn's Woods""

The state is one of the 13 original founding states of the United States; it came into being in 1681 as a result of a royal land grant to William Penn, the son of the state's namesake. Part of Pennsylvania (along the Delaware River), together with the present State of Delaware, had earlier been organized as the Colony of New Sweden. It was the second state to ratify the United States Constitution, on December 12, 1787. Independence Hall, where the United States Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution were drafted, is located in Philadelphia, the state's largest city. During the American Civil War, the Battle of Gettysburg was fought in the south central region of the state. Valley Forge near Philadelphia was General Washington's headquarters during the bitter winter of 1777–78."
"It means Penn's (William Penn - man granted the colony by the King of England) woods. Similarly, Transylvania means ""on the side of the woods."""
It was going to be called Transylvania but then someone built a Penn station subs so they changed it.
Yep. It means Penn’s Forest because the guy who founded it was named William Penn. Interesting that it is actually named after his father who received the land from a King.
I think Utah and a Ohio and the other states whose names come from native american tribes are weirder

No. House would vote by state delegation in early January. Anyone who got at least 1 electoral vote would be eligible.

Then we wait until January 6th, 2021. That's when Congress certifies the results and makes this all official.

About 63-65%

Because getting all the mail in ballots back in Alaska takes a long time due to how big the state is and how far apart towns/villages are.

Still stressing everybody out. Apparently Trump needs to get 56% of all remaining votes to win and a good number are in blue counties? Hope.
A little over a thousand votes dropped about an hour ago. Trump was on pace to catch up in that one.

"I've been tracking changes according to The Associated Press numbers for about five hours now so my numbers aren't representative of the whole day. 

In the time I've been tracking Biden has gotten 68.5% of the votes. 

Bear in mind that this comes in large part from a major jump about 30 minutes ago or so where he got 4708 votes to Trump's 1462. 

Prior to that he was around getting about 61.3% of the vote."

Official is when results are certified and electors picked.

Which *always* takes weeks.  Counts are still ongoing even though we know the results.

So the “final” announcement is more like dozens of them independently by states.

We get unofficial announcements when news outlets feel confident enough to make them."
Electors
"Technically, there isn't a final outcome until Congress certifies the electoral votes (the Electoral College will vote on December 14th) in January.

The media will likely project the winner before we have a final vote count, which will come from the state governments."

They're not going to say shit til Nov 12. Probably hoping PA decides it so they don't have to be the ones to cause Trump to lose.
NC said they wouldn’t update till around the 12th
All the vote they have Is counted. But they can receive mail ballots up until Nov 12. It’s too close to call without those. It’s probably not gonna matter.
NC allows ballots to be received until Nov 12
"It's pretty much done, they can receive ballots for a few days. Not gonna flip at this point."
Not really. I'm guessing it's pretty much guaranteed to go red so everyone's ignoring it
"NC won't report any time soon, they accept late ballots and are waiting for that."
Good BBQ
Is NC still a state? They seemed to have given us the slip.
"It's a Trump win, not really in play for Biden."
"NC from what was said on CNN has counted everything they have. They have not received 118k absentee ballots that were sent out. NC notes that some of those people may have voted in person and they do not have that info.

Also, NC voters have until 12th to get their ballots in. So no later than the 12th."
"PA, probably. AZ and NV wont call until the weekend."
Looking like PA or Georgia.
"Probably Arizona? PA and GA are going to be too close to call even when all votes are balloted, so recounts will be necessary there"
Georgia
"GA. It looks like.  My next guess would be AZ but that wouldn't occurred till late Friday or the weekend at the earliest.

PA, NV, NC, and AZ might not get called till next week.

Ballots have till the 10th in NV and the 12th for NC. NC only has about 118K outstanding absentee ballots left. They said some of those people may have voted in person. So it's possible NC is done but no one is likely to call it before the 12th.

PA still has ballots received after Nov. 3rd to count. Deadline for ballots is tomorrow at 5pm est. They'll start counting if no new leagle  challenges occur from Trump."
It should be NV but it’s kinda awkward for the networks that already called AZ because that would seal a Biden win.
Alaska!
Yes.
Yeah I think counter and reported are 2 different things
In PA?
During the CNN round table earlier it was said that the Secretary of State made a mistake when she said there were over 500k uncounted ballots this afternoon and it was actually was closer to the 300k

"Toomey is not a servile idiot. He just played one for Trump and, well, 2022 ain’t that far off."
"don't, just don't"
There has never been so many mailed in ballots which takes longer to count
"It always takes this long. It’s just there’s rarely such a difference in the type of vote, once they count 20% they can extrapolate. Not with mail in.

You also have to literally open two envelopes per vote."
"Huge numbers of mail in votes that weren't allowed to be counted until election day. And unlike in-person ballots, mail-in take longer because of the verification process that's required. Additionally, some states are accepting ballots so long as they are postmarked by election day. 

Finally, it often does take time to count all the ballots. It's just that most years the stranglers didn't have the potential to change the outcome."

The rest are basically all mail in ballots which greatly favor Biden. Gaps are closing before our eyes.
CNN just reported that he is going to speak at 6:30 PM Eastern standard time.

Yes. 20min supposedly.

Someone said Cumberland Co. (Carlisle)

Cumberland.
Over. It was a red area and he got almost 50%
"Overperform. Clinton lost by 16% here, Biden is only down 10%. Good for overall state numbers for Biden. 

Biden took about 2/3rds of this dump, he will need to do better in Philly."
"He over performed by A LOT. This county was one where Biden was down by a lot (about 10 points). Biden gained about 20,000 net votes over trump here."
I would cum if they announced the race in the middle of his tantrum

They are segregated currently
They will be counted but sequestered so not part of the tally
No they are not. They have segregated those.
They are probably counting them anyway and just taking note.
It’s 10000 ballots. They are waiting to see if they will matter based on candidate margin.
the final counts will prob be ones received before or on election day and the ones after will be counted later.

CNN had someone on the phone with Erie. She read the numbers they gave her and they wrote it down.
they had it on cnn live about 15 mins ago
It was live on cnn a few minutes ago
CNN (on air) had it hand written over their digital wall a few minutes ago as it hadn't been updated yet.
"CNN reporter on site said she got the numbers early from a source, so the map won’t reflect that until they’re officially released, I believe."

Last I saw (couple hours ago) was 70k?
Just above 40k seems to be a conservative bid.
Humbly.
At least a few hundred thousand I believe
Based on the last numbers they posted on 85K as of 2 hours ago. Not sure how many of the last batches were from them so I'm gonna guess 70-75K

If they were adding illegal votes, then the number of votes would exceed those numbers...Especially the amount that the idiots seem to think are fake (10s if not 100s of thousands).

This is mail in ballot so the % will be different. It has been very good for Biden. Do not worry.
I meant Biden will get more out of these mail in ballots even in red county.
"According to NBC: Estimated 75,561 votes remain to be counted. Biden down by 3,635. Fulton, Gwinnett, Chatham, Clayton, Cobb, Forsyth and Dekalb counties are responsible for over 85% of the remaining votes. All counties except Forsyth heavily favor Biden. Forsyth is smaller then most of the counties stated above and most likely doesn’t have more then 5,000 votes left to count.

Source: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-elections/georgia-president-results

I’d break it down further into more counties, appx amount of votes per county and percentage favoring Biden, but by the time I did all that Biden probably would have already taken the lead."

The vote increases have average 25% trump 75% Biden for the past 24 hours. :) we only need them to avg 64% to turn blue.
"on one hand i agree with your feeling

on the other hand i'd rather they take time rather than give trump to cry"

I'm pretty sure I head that right."
Thank you for the temperature check
Doesn't the military usually vote DEM?
"All of them have already been counted I think, but more could arrive and be counted. The GA election guy said so this AM."
"Are military predominantly republican, democratic, or mixed?"
Wow.  I bet they go like 80/20 for Trump.
"And you are right in that the military votes NORMALLY favor the Republican, but this is anything but normal.  He has said enough rubbish to possibly rub enough people the wrong way to lose that vote too."
"The more states that Trump takes the more likely it is he can steal the election in the SCOTUS. I’m personally hoping for NV, AZ and PA. If Biden gets GA that is just icing on the cake, but at the same time its so close that it will probably be another Florida 2000 if Biden pulls it out."
Fuck that lets take em all. Put a few extra nails in the coffin.
Or we could just take all or 3 of those which is possible!
"He won't, though."
All on the Biden bus!
NV and Georgia and AZ are going for Biden dumbass
No this is the AOC 47 thread
"Right, but these ballots aren’t just residents of your unbelievably beautiful county, it’s ballots cast by mail by your neighbors.  And those have tended to be overwhelmingly for Biden."
"When I went to Savannah, I seem to remember it getting more conservative the further from the river you got. Is it still the same way now?"
"The national party didn't do enough work here, unfortunately. They only really started to see the value of putting effort into Georgia at the very end. By that time, it was too late to drive much more than a near-stalemate."
GA's been trending purple just like Arizona has for a bit now. It'll make future elections interesting.
"For sign language thats very common. A lot of context is lost in signing, and it helps a great deal."
"Facial expressions are really important to conveying the tone of what the speaker is saying, so his facial expressions are part of him being a good interpreter. Tone of voice is so important in conveying meaning, and that extra layer helps people who use ASL get that meaning."
"That’s a proper sign language technique. Emphasis and tone are hard to convey without sound, so they use exaggerated gestures and facial expressions."
Facial gestures are sort of like the individuality and tone of someone's signing. Sort of like an accent or affectation.
If i remember correctly it helps with inflection.  Where you can change pitch with your voice they use facial expressions to denote similar ideas.  If i remembered correctly...
It's normal for the Deaf community to communicate through facial expressions moreso than the average person. It's probably just part of how he learned to sign.
i took one ASL class in college and the facial expressions were required to past the exams.
"Sign language is all about the facial expressions, the more exaggerated they are, the more emphasis or stress there is on the words they’re signing"
Facial expressions are an important part of sign language interpreter work
"Its part of the language. While we have tone of voice, they use facial expressions to do this."
Imagine being deaf. Then think a second. You may arrive at an answer.
"No, 431,723 per NYT"
Yeah and with the current margins that means that Biden wins.
Thats a ton of votes to make up 90k or whatever it is. Biden's been getting 78% of the vote today; he could only get 70% of the vote and still win by approx 40k votes...CNN just showed the math.
"Biden needs less than 2/3 of those, and he's been winning way more than 2/3 of what's been coming in.  He's fine."
"It's all good. We'll take 245k of those and win by 75,000 votes."

About 250k should go for Joe.

"no 35 is fine. as a 25 year old, I truly dont want someone in my state of maturity running the country."
I don't think it rules many candidates out. But there should be an upper age limit.
I would not want a president younger than 35.
Maybe a maximum age should be introduced? I’m from the UK and we would benefit from this too.  Corbyn was 70 when he ran against Boris last year!

You are making him seem way smarter than he is. He's not capable of such evil mastermind plans because he's stupid.
"Trump could have easilly won reelction if he mounted a real defense against covid and did everything he could to prevent people from getting infected and dying. He chose to make it a game of politics when it was blue states.

A war time president always wins, the battle against covid was a war, Trump just decided not to fight for half the country."
He can cry all he wants - those ballots are not illegal.  We’ve had mail in voting long before Covid.
"I dont think he has the mental capacity to think that up, but he does have the immorality."
That's giving him too muh credit. I believe in the summer he thought he'd blow out any opponent. I think the man just straight up fucked himself being himself and giving the election to dems through the mishandling of the pandemic. Mail in ballots have partly resulted in the highest turnout in recent history.
"He's not that smart. Neither is anyone else on his team.  Kushner is on record as wanting it to ravage the coastal cities & states believing that it wouldn't impact the conservative leaning states. There are three upsides to this for them:

1. Dead democrats
2. Pointing to the democratic mayors and governors and saying, ""See, they suck!""
3. Democratic strongholds struggling to keep their shit together can't organize effective voting pushes.

The mail-in voting thing was a convenient wedge that they didn't plan, they just took the opportunity to rabble-rouse.

I'm even on the fence about #3 -- it might be too clever. They really only have murder, name calling, and finger pointing as tools."
Those were mostly his voters.  He cost himself the election....and needlessly killed off hundreds of thousands of americans....so far.

That's the most right thing you've ever done.
Looks like Biden is going to easily win a larger percentage of the American population than Obama or Reagan.
yep!
republican = dumb and/or bad
This comment = obvious
I know you are being sarcastic but you are not wrong.
This = true
Good job buddy. Do the colors next
"It is a bit frustrating though, to see people reporting from Decision Desk or wherever, and then wearing out my F5 button waiting for this one to get feed from NYTimes."
Imagine the pain republicans are in watching their leads slowly slip away
Yeah this is flat out absurd. Almost every other state counted millions of votes by the first night. What the fuck is going on
It’s to stroke fear in their base and drum up ratings.  That is all.
"It will be interesting to have a President again that all news networks go after.

Edit: I dont mean that as in ""Biden is going to do bad things"" but more in ""Fox attacks Dem presidents and every other news channel attacks both."""
I’m sure it was the same four years ago. Both operate on fear/shock
Do you mean because Fox called AZ and CNN still hasn't? I took that to be preparing for worst-case scenarios rather than favouring the other side.
To be a bit cynical I believe both are just trying to hook their audience. If CNN or fox were extremely confident in their candidate all their viewers would go do something else.
It has nothing to do with favoring and everything to do with math.
CNN is being cautious bc conservatives screech about them.  Fox is trying to either role up their base with the calls or this is Murdoch ghosting Trump
Fox is ready to move on to bashing Biden for the next 4 years instead of pandering to Trump's insane rambling. Next couple weeks are going to be crazy as the rightwing news bubble implodes
"How is CNN favoring conservative? They just haven't called Az yet, for good reason."
"Most likely Saturday based on mail in ballots, deadlines and things like that"
Correct
What happened? Missed this.
Looks like he might take Minnesota!
lol. He's a shoe-in.
They get the hose again?
Apparently one county says they will take until the 12th to count all the ballots... HOW DOES IT TAKE A WEEK?
"Knowing Nevada, thats precisely what they want.  A good hard spanking"
Seriously. Wth are they doing?
Best joke I’ve heard all sub
Fat chance.
Nobody would concede until they've officially lost. He hasn't

I see the legal weed has already started at your house.

Its a well known fact in AZ late votes lean R. The biggest thing is if Biden can keep his lead knowing Maricopa will have late ballots leaning R. Which is hilarious considering the guy they are voting for is saying those ballots shouldn't count
The 326k figure is mail-ins only. The total is 395k
More than enough
According to the official PA vote dashboard is 327k mail in ballots left to count.
Yeah I’m confused
"From the nyt
Pennsylvania’s top election official says it may take longer than expected to complete the count there. Her office says about 326,000 mail ballots still need to be counted"
"was 500K about 90 minutes ago.

Probably around 450K now.

By hand they have to open 2 envelopes, check for a decent sig, check the person didn't vote twice like Trump  encouraged his lunatics to do.

They have to do this with observers and security breathing down their necks and armed Trump supporters screaming outside the building and most of the world having an anxiety attack focused on these people.

It's not a nice place to be.  No one is smiling or joking like this is fun.   If someone has to eat, piss or shit it's an ordeal."
394k
395k
">My Profile

You can check the official PA voting site for the actual numbers."
Over 100k
"CNN says 8%, so 500k or sumtin. But 300k mail-ins right now, and those are the ones that have been so devestating to Trump."
"PA Secretary of State said their elections dashboard numbers are the best count to check, and they're constantly updating:


https://www.votespa.com/About-Elections/Pages/Counting-Dashboard.aspx"
i think every state is waiting to release all at once so as not to be the tipping point
[https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html) shows that the last update from Georgia was 7 minutes ago.
"fivrthirtyeight posted this to their blog at about 4 pm eastern:  

""Georgia: Trump currently leads here by a razor-thin margin (12,768 votes) with 47,277 ballots left to count. Most of those are expected to be counted today, but at least one county (Chatham, where about 17,000 ballots are outstanding) says it will need until tomorrow. So whether we’ll get a projection here later today is murky, too."""
There was an update 6 mins ago
"might be, i know savannah is stopped till tomorrrow morn and they still have a big chunk of votes left"
Chatham said they would be releasing more tonight.
Probably.
The SoS said they'd count into the night
"> Trump may take AZ

based on what"
That’s what it sounds like.
whats that make the total
idk about pa and ga but i bet my left dong biden takes AZ
Biden has a higher chance of a snagging all four than Trump getting AZ lmao
[deleted]
"Think the AP (and Fox) will be vindicated and Biden will take AZ

Expect him to fall just short in GA

But I’ve been wrong before. About a lot"
Source?
where you seeing this??
[deleted]
What’s the plan there? Make it appear Trump is gaining ground? How does that help him?
"Source?

I hope this is true"
"Wait, we were winning and now we're not winning as much?!?

FRAUD!!

We need to mobilize and get eyes in those rooms now!!"
Do we have evidence of that? And what would the point even be?
Is that good or bad for Biden?
They will publish Maricopa county at 9 pm EST
Really? How do you know? I hope you're right btw
Boris johnson
"We might, if PA finishes today"
It’s a definite maybe
Nah.
We are
"If Pennsylvania finishes, yes"
Nope !  You can count on it !
Pennsylvania says they’ll be mostly done by the end of the night. If that swings towards Biden then the call can be made
Always has been

Is AOC in the chat ?
Decapitated. Whole big thing. We had a funeral for a bird.

Things.

Time for that Night Court episode where they have the super slow talker.
Lots of small uploads.
As long as it closes
"It's def being super slow to report... but with that said, the margins seem to be right on track! \*fingers crossed\*"
9500
"It looks VERY likely at this point.  But there will likely be a recount, so..."
"If it makes you feel any better, it looks like AZ is going back to Trump?"
Means there are 2 senate seats in GA up for grabs TBD in January
Basically another election in January.
"It's only good because it gives dems one last chance to flip the senate.  If no one wins 50% of the vote, the top two candidates advance to a run off.  This is now gonna happen for both Georgia senate seats.  Downside is run offs have lower turnout which favours the republican candidates."
it's a revote.
"No one gets over 50% so the two candidates with the highest number of votes have another election just the pair of them (in January, I think) to determine a clear mandate."
"It's another election between the top two candidates only for each senate seat. It's good because it doesn't mean that the Republicans 100% have the senate locked up, yet."
"It's a special election where, because neither candidate got over 50%, they need to have another vote.

This would mean that there's a solid chance we, as Democrats, can refocus on the campaigns of the Democrats there, and if we cinch both seats, odds are we'll have the Senate."
"A runoff election is a second round of elections since no candidate got over 50%. They're going to take the top 2 candidates and have a new election. Its good because it means we didn't lose, but winning it will be difficult"
"Georgia requires a runoff vote, which is just a vote between the two top candidates for offices where the winner gets less than  50% of the popular vote. Right now both senate races will go to run off in GA. Meaning that there is a chance GA will elect two Democratic senators. It's better to win outright, but this gives us a real shot at having a senate majority."
"A runoff election is a second election held to determine a winner when no candidate in the first election met the required threshold for victory. Runoff elections can be held for both primary elections and general elections.

https://ballotpedia.org/Runoff_election"
"In GA, a senatorial candidate must win 50% of the vote to be elected. Otherwise, the top two candidates will go to a run-off. It’s not necessarily good, but it means there will be no 3rd party candidates siphoning votes"
"An election specifically between the top 2 candidates. No 3rd party votes. 

It's not great for us, but it's better than if Perdue stayed above 50% because instead of him definitely winning tonight he will only maybe win on the runoff election day"
"It means that neither senate candidate secured over 50% of the vote, so therefore has to be another mini election. Its good for us because Trump voters don't come out as much when his name isn't on the ballot, so if we secure the two Georgia seats we have a senate majority and then Biden is essentially unrestrained instead of having Mitch block everything."
"Its basically if neither candidate can get a 50% majority vote then they have another election...if both senate seats in Georgia go to a run off,  then the Dems have another chance of picking up two senate seats to win the senate majority"
Yes
Not how that works
Do you know how electors are chosen?
Is this shit gonna be done in 8 hours time? Cause Jesus Christ
"Fox News, baby. Love when they have no choice but to say the truth. Except some of the same clowns spewing bullshit - Waters right now."
Apparently Eric was bitching about the GOP being MIA through all this so looks like you got a hit on at least one of the items on your list.
The number of  total votes seems to be similar to 2016. Seems fishy to me. Like mail in ballots are missing.
we'll ave a winner once PA finishes counting
Not sure how many left but trump down to 9k
Last I heard it was like 35-40k ballots statewide?
" 43,385 

You can follow along here - [https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html) \- though I believe it is liable to be wrong or delayed if new votes are brought in. But it takes it directly from state websites."
"43385 left.

Biden is on pace to win GA by 7644 votes."
hes gonna speak to the president of puerto rico
North Korea?
Russia
Florida
Maybe he’ll rip open his shirt to reveal the XXL superman shirt beneath it
That would explain why he hasn't been tweeting the last 5 hours. His tailors have been frantically altering it because he's gained so much weight.

If there was ever a time to do it. This would be it.
Gaps closing. 50k votes left to count
"perdue ossoff senate race also going to runoff, perdue dipped below 50%.  


Trumps lead is down to 9k votes last AP update. so it seems more and more like ITS HAPPENING"
[https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html)
"Down to 9.5k difference with votes being counted in Fulton County. Not exactly clear how many there are left to count total but seems to be between 39k-43k, mostly mail-ins from Chatham and Clayton county which lean heavily blue, but a few smaller red counties as well. That doesn't include the ballots from overseas military personnel, of which there seems to be 8-9k and could end up being crucial with how close it is."
"Still red, approx 9k difference between the two, 99% of votes counted (last 1% is 50k votes)"
"It is getting tighter. Trump has a 9k lead, but there are plenty of votes left."
"9K difference in favor with Trump with about 40K left to count.  Currently Biden is getting around 70% of the remaining votes so if this holds, Biden will get GA.  I would add that they will very likely do a recount since it's going to be really close."
Rumor is that he is announcing conceding the presidency.
"Oh I imagine everywhere, as always."
You can probably watch it on cnn.com
Ham radio
should be live on all the news channels
What speech?
"HBO MAX, it's gonna be crazy"
"all news will. youtube will air it, just search ""live election coverage"" and pick a live station."
Probably any major news channel. Take your pick!
Moving in the right direction overall in PA and GA. Biden's victory looks likely but not assured.
"Trump up by 78k in Pennsylvania, dwindling by the minute. He's up by 9k in Georgia, it could go either way depending on where remaining ballots are coming from. Nevada looking good for democrats, Arizona probably blue but could turn red."
Georgia has a gap of under 10k votes.
"looking good in GA and PA, not looking great in AZ"
Looking good. Georgia and Pennsylvania likely to go to Biden.
Briefing room which may mean he takes questions. Which means no script.
I think there is a discrepancy between votes that haven't been counted and votes that have been counted but not been tallied.
I think there might be votes that are counted but not reported. The SoS of PA alluded to that earlier today and looking at the number of votes left to count vs the total number of votes that have been reported since she said there were like 500 left to count dont add up
No.  There are varying figures of votes remaining. The 350k number was mail in ballots. It's unclear if any other types of votes exist out there.
"I have been thinking the same thing, but the number of votes left to count is all over the place."
Yes
That 350K for Biden sounds way high - I don't know where those numbers came from
"I just posted about the github project too. It's so useful!   


Curious where you are seeing the remaining count on CNN. I had been looking for it on the site but it seems buried or not there. (Or, I'm just overtired from staring at screens too long and just missed it. lol! Totally possible)"
"I'm wondering a similar thing.  A user shared their calculations and their number looks off for the Dems projected loss of margin for Arizona.  Shouldn't it be -85,430, not 8,543 as shown?"
I am not but the Orb Mother's positive energy cannot be denied
"Who knows, maybe healing crystals could help us!"
This will be their 'evidence' for the other cases.
Put a bunch of DROP TABLE 's in there
Not til the 12th likely
Nothing really.  It's been stagnant with \~6-7% outstanding on top of the ballots they are trying to track down in USPS distribution centers.  Just glad that Cal didn't concede yet - he's been quiet.
No. Won't be till the 12th at the earliest.
"They’re accepting mail ins until the 12th, so don’t expect a call much before then"
theyve taken the NV approach of staying out of any deciding factors
It's not on fire.
"Probably staying red, but that was expected."
What did the horse do to deserve that?
He should be forced to drink Santorum.
Because they haven't slept properly since Sunday night.
Same reason they thought the election was a lost cause on election night?
Trump needs to hit 58% and last dump was 67%
"They're not reading the map. We're supposed to see the gap shrink due to red precincts being counted first, then Biden will take over from there.

Even the Biden campaign said they were expecting this"
Trump has been pulling in better margins than he needs with new vote drops to ultimately pull ahead
Chatham won't come in until tomorrow.
"Last moved 12 minutes ago just small batches at a time. I've been using this link to watch. 

https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html"
looks like the last county is reporting tonight
"I can't watch it but not because of technical reasons.  I heard his first sentence and I was like ""I'm out!"""
Not good if it's a liberal strong hold and Trump won it
"Considering they’re a liberal county and Biden got less, no not good."
Fine as hell
I don't think anybody knows the right play here. I think there has to be a balance between letting people off the hook and making people think they have nothing to lose by radicalizing.
Nah fuck them.
"I'd really rather be petty and rub it in their faces, personally."
"Everyone has been piling on the Right ever since we swung back, but I think it’s important we remember that we are all Americans. Politics can get really nasty but we should all take a second to examine the situation and realize that these guys are assholes and it was so satisfying seeing them beat."
They can't hurt you as long as you stand still.
You won't win friendship from a bully by being nice. Their hate has nothing to do with Dems.
"lol, nah, I'm gonna continue to dunk on fascists"
Yeah no
I know quite a few Republicans who are never-Trumpers and didn't like Romney either. So baseless blanket statements like this is are just as harmful.
That’s a no dawg
I personally wonder if the Northeast and the West Coast would be better off forming their own countries.
"Everything ends eventually. The strongest empires in the world have all fallen at some point, and there's no reason that it won't happen again.

"I mean at some point sure.

I don’t expect an extant USA 10,000 years from now."
"Dude, effin crazy how many people there are on each side. There's such a strong divide in the nation."
Yeah regardless of the final result here this country is dangerously polarized
As an european it is a weird mix of watching the balkanization of the us and kind of the downfall of the roman empire.
That will not happen. To assume that is to assume that most Americans are willing to hurt one another. And I can't see that.

Please refer to the last 4 years of the Obama presidency.
Its extremely broken.
At least we can restore the executive branch to decency.
"Foreign policy/relations, executive branch and cabinet positions, hell even boosting the country's morale are just a few of the things the pres can do independent of senate."
It gives Dems and excuse to not do anything meaningful and people will blame it on Republicans. It's just like the Obama years despite having a supermajority his first two years.
"He can still pass things like executive orders. Basically mandates the president can hand down that aren't laws per se.   
It's also important to remember that the Senate could be up for grabs in 2022, and 2024, so it's not like he'll always be presiding over a split congress.   


&#x200B;

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive\_order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order)"
Having an ineffectual moderate Democrate is much better than having a fascist.
"well inherently the system is broken because the founder's believed that all politicians would hold the country above their own/their parties goals/machinations.... Now we know the GOP is a homogenous blob that will only vote for what the party wants, not what the country needs."
"We would have to hope that Biden is someone who can work with Republicans to compromise and come to an agreement. Sure Biden won't be able to do exactly what he wants, but he may be able to get some things passed.
Look at Obamacare for example. That is not how Obama wanted it to be, but had to compromise with his Republican majority senate."
It's a broken system for sure. But at least the damage can be halted if we get trump out.
"The way Democrats see it, I assume (I'm also not from the states):  
a good guy trying to do stuff and blocked some of the times is better than a bad guy trying to do stuff and not getting blocked."
"1. Restore dignity to the position and our country 
2. Executive orders
3. Flip the senate in 2 years 
4. Rejoin Paris climate accord
5. Profit"
"Because the Preisdent is the Head of Government. Therefore he control the day by day activities of the government, armed forces and intelligence services. The President need both houses of congress to pass laws and both houses can stop the presidents action. However the president can also enact executive decrees, which are basically laws the President can enact without Congress."
"The current system is broken, but the republican party won't cooperate in changing it because they have an advantage in the senate and electoral college."
Presidents do other things besides sign bills into office. Besides theres another election in 2 years where dems could potentially take the senate.
"The president of the senate, the vp, can use procedure to hear the minority speaker instead of the majority, then we just pick off a couple Republicans per bill with a minor log roll on funding a military base in their state or whatever and bing bang boom they turn on each other and the system slowly starts working again.

But as to what's the point? I mean... not having a nazi be president is its own reward"
"There is a LOT a president can do on his own. It would be better with both houses, but don’t get it twisted. Just having Joe in office would make an insane difference."
"the system was designed to counter-balance one another, so that we don't live in a dictatorship. No one group can take power easily and pass legislation that can harm Americans... this comes with the flipside where it is difficult to pass legislation that can help Americans.

Typically in a system such as this, there was some bipartisanship where both sides agree on certain issues and compromise over issues that are undeniable, and vote together. Unfortunately, there's been a huge shift forward to never compromising, and holding things hostage.

A more difficult issue imo is how to get the heavy influence of money and corporate desires/lobbyists out of government, since many ppl in goverment have completely disregarded American values and rights for the dollar (also difficult because typically more money to a campaign = win). A lot of them vote in ways that directly hurt Americans in order to satisfy those corporations."
"There are big things we want- health care, clear path for citizenship for legal immigrants and for illegal immigrants to be treated as humans and not animal, climate protections, etc. If we do not have control of all of the branches, big things will not get done. However, our government is not designed to have big things happen quickly-
in fact, it is SUPPOSED to be slow and cumbersome so that we can catch errors in policy through debate.  In other words, it's supposed to be quite boring. However, 2016 changed that. Control of all 3 branches, we saw how barely we were able to cling to ACA. We saw the Trump tax cuts pass while line items were chickenscratched in pencil, saddling future generations in massive debt while rich folks laughed to the bank. This was not supposed to happen. It's OK to have a Republican Senate and a Dem president, so things can be slowly worked out and deals made. The forefathers, while wise in designing a slow system, failed in many ways. They relied heavily on those elected to govern to possess the decorum and professionalism to work out such indifferences and come to a civil conclusion. McConnell and Trump together were literally the raptors testing the fences, pushing at the boundaries of how much they can get away with. McConnell is a blatant obstructionist, blocking legislation coming from a Democrat House, and how he can push through federal judges. In other words, he has no decorum. There are flaws in our system that need fixes- Senate Majority should not have power to block legislation from the house. We need a consensus on election year passing of Supreme Court justices (more like term limits). If Biden wins, much legislation will be gridlocked. However, there is much Biden can do. He can enact Executive Orders. His cabinet will be far more helpful to the American people than Trump's grifters. Those things matter, even if it's not the big things we need to fix.  edit- words"
Undoing many of the executive orders by trump will not require any help from congress or the judiciary
"Yeah, you hit the nail on the head. 

It’s a broken, awful, system. It was never supposed to be this way."
It's still worth it because we prevented a malignant narcissist with facist tendencies from gaining a second term where he can still do so much more damage.
It would prevent stacking courts with more Federalist judges? It changes the administration from being used as a way to obfuscate and promote currupt practices to supporting actually following laws and morality?
"it's broken but not pointless. you're right in that the two party system bends towards inaction. a lot of people in comments saying that the system was designed in a certain way, but there's no design that went into a two-party system in the states. and there's nothing in any federal law stating this but there are a lot of states that have laws on the books making it difficult for non-party candidates to appear on the ballot. some people say alternate voting systems could help fix the system, [this video (22:07 on) explains maine's current attempt](https://youtu.be/MykMQfmLIro?t=1326) and what its done to campaign ads (tl;dr instant runoff voting allowed candidates to campaign on issues that they agreed on, and not just tear each other down because no one would be ""stealing"" votes away from anyone else).

as far as passing bills: a lot of other routine stuff gets done on more blurry partisan lines and small changes there can matter.

changes to federal agency leadership can matter too. right now our environmental protection agency is being used [as a propaganda tool for the oil and gas industry](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/icymi-trump-administration-has-removed-environmental-regulations-hamstring-american). the president appoints the heads of a lot of important federal agencies."
I honestly wouldn't put it past him based on the last four years. He often skirts around the edges of calls to violence and praises violent people.
No one thinks he'll invite violence. He doesn't have to. His supporters are already violent -- that's the problem.
what do you think his claims of voter fraud will lead to? Are you forgetting his 'DO SOMETHING' tweet?
"I feel like I was in a media bubble meant to scare me, because the whole ""civil war"" narrative really is not shaping up to be very scary. I thought Trump morons would be riding through the streets picking people off with machine guns. It looks like they're actually just sort of squealing and moaning lmao"
"We all remember he told the proud boys to ""stand by"", and made a lot of similar statements. 

I'm sure that everything you said he would say, he WILL say. But I still won't be surprised if, as his chances continue to dwindle, he starts saying things about how ""American patriots"" should ""make sure democracy is protected"" by overseeing counting and such."
"How is claiming that the election was stolen not inciting violence? He's literally accusing Dems of a coup.

I don't think anyone is assuming he will literally say 'Kill all Democrats!'. But for those that believe his rhetoric (and there are many) he is providing them all the justification they need."
"""trust but verify"".  In this situation, it means we expect and demand that the President of the United States does not commit treason against the country.  But if he does, our governors are ready stop him."
"PA is Biden's, just uncalled 

Don't need Arizona anymore anyway"
As long as Georgia and PA continue to head towards Biden Arizona won't matter
"While in most other states, mail in ballots tend to favour democrats, in Arizona the mail in ballots tend to be republican."

In full fairness, though, AZ looks like it's headed to recount territory as whoever wins is likely to win by less than 10k votes, definitely less than 1%.

That being said, Georgia and Nevada are looking very bad for Trump at the moment."
Trump will probably win AZ. People are clinging to AP calling it but the trends for a Trump come back in AZ is as strong if not stronger than Biden winning PA. But who cares because my boy blue is gonna win GA and PA
I believe there is still a democratic stronghold that has yet to be counted.
"He could but in a couple hours it may not matter, Pa is heading overwhelmingly to Biden and Ga may or may not flip tonight too"
who care. we got PA and GA
"Maybe, until they start counting the mail-in ballots."
What are you basing that reduction on.
"It's going to be a 40k win for him if he does WORSE than he is currently doing.  
  
And when the provisionals start getting counted (and we have no idea how many there are) they will also pad the numbers.  It'll be +100k at the end."
"Huh? If he only hits 70% of mail in ballots left, he'll be +40k.  This doesn't count provisional ballots of which there are many."
"CNN was just showing how he could win by 40,000 votes.  He’s been getting 78% of the mail-in votes that were counted today.  If he gets 70% of the remaining votes to be counted, he’d win by 40,000."
"I'm actually worried about PA again, before we were going off numbers from the estimated percentage on sites like nytimes, which gave over 410k votes left. To find out it's almost 100k less is disheartening. With my math, unless there's a miracle, he won't make it."
Check Dave Wasserman's latest tweet
"They stopped counting in Pittsburghs county for ""administration needs"". If he wins today his win will only widen once counting resumes."
I think Biden is going to take PA by 55k votes.. quote me!
"Assuming he holds the win, all he needs is PA."
https://twitter.com/Redistrict/status/1324481460280217601?s=20
Where are you getting that? PA is gonna be much bigger than a 10k margin for Biden
Yeah its so hard to keep up with the numbers because we keep getting random numbers about how many votes are left to report. I think Biden needs to average 65% of the remaining votes using the numbers from PA's official website. That seems like it should be a Biden win
"“If that’s not voter fraud, I don’t know what is?” Lol. 

My guess is the dude is mad that people can’t fill out ballots correctly and it’s making his job harder under already immense pressure, so when he finds yet ANOTHER bad ballot, he just crumpled it up and tossed it to the side. Didn’t throw it away or shred it, just put it to the side."
That’s what I would say it is but I’m not a professional haha
Who fucking knows. At worst it is a guy throwing away a single ballot. Investigate him and correct it if it was fraud. It’s not proof of any widespread conspiracy.
"Honest answer, we don't know. These people are under a lot of stress right now. The whole country is telling them to hurry the fuck up.

But no matter what it is, this is one person. We don't know what was up with that ballot. It could have had racist bullshit written on it. It could have been null. Could have given him a paper cut. We don't know. It's not acceptable behavior and it's the last thing we need right now, but I know what it's not. It's not proof of some leftist conspiracy."
Yes
PA flips and ends this
"Biden with a great chance for PA, NV
Good chance for AZ
Decent chance for GA"
"There are only two outcomes and it's been that way since WI and MInwere called.

Trump needs to win the last four states. Biden just needs one.

Inb4 some troll says what about AZ. Biden already won AZ stop it with the propaganda"
"Like in terms of trends?

GA will likely finish the bulk of the counting tonight, current trends show Biden flipping it by a thin margin. After that I believe there are 8k military votes that need to be counted, plus a small batch which need to be reprocessed.

NV is expected to end strongly for Biden, as there are a large number of ballets (est. 63k) which need to be counted in Clark County and those alone will greatly turn the scales in Biden's favor. We won't know more about NV until tomorrow

AZ is going to be a tight race. Currently Trump is averaging right around the split he needs to overtake Biden. It is possible we will see a late flip by a thin margin, similar to the GA situation. Won't know more about this until more votes come in. Expected to be updated at 9p est.

PA looks to also end strongly for Biden, as he continues to outpace the margin needed to overtake Trump. PA is hoping to finish counting before the end of the night."
"Data says:

Biden wins AZ, NV, PA.

Trump wins AL, NC, Maine 2nd.

Georgia is 50/50."
"Biden wins PA, NV, and AZ. NC goes to Trump. Georgia is a straight up coin flip."
"Biden can clinch GA by a crazy small lead if the math keeps up.

Biden is expected to slowly, confidently turn PA blue, similar to what we saw with MI and WI

Biden has multiple paths to win. Trump needs to win both PA and GA to stay viable."
"Biden takes pa, nv, az. Ga too close and goes to recount.  We start months of accusations and lawsuits.  Biden eventually becomes prez with an obstructionist red senate and gets blamed for doing nothing."
"PA and NV will almost certainly wind up Biden. GA is very close but its still a toss up. Arizona will most likely stay Biden as well but is also quite close. 

Biden only needs AZ + NV, which he currently has, or PA, which he is almost certain to get. GA would be a nice addition, but isn't really needed unless he loses AZ."
The simplest scenario is Biden wins PA and everything else doesn't matter.  The current trend and numbers we see makes this highly probable.  But still nervous as hell.
"Likely PA later tonight for Biden to clinch. Possibly GA also, but that would not be enough for 270."
Not really. They still raise their kid together. There was a clip somewhere of both of them on set facetiming their son together to say goodnight. Some divorces can be amicable.

"I'm really not exaggerating:  No.

It's been kinda nice actually, I actually got some work done today."
"Nope, nothing. Been doing ragdoll stuff?"
of course. PA/GA don't flip and he wins either AZ or NV. nothing is certain until it's official
"It would require multiple miracles. If any state that's left goes to Biden, Biden wins. We're just biden our time."
I suppose it’s POSSIBLE but unlikely.
"Yup.  He can't lose Pennsylvania, though."
"If he keeps GA, PA AND AZ yes. But looks like GA and PA are gonna flip. AZ is still very close."
"If he is to win, he has a LOT of ground to make up"
Of course. Or else we wouldn’t be here.
Imma say no just for my sanity
Possible yes but none of the numbers are going his direction
"yes, but slimmer than bidens chances. sorry if thats fucking vague but thats where we are at"
"He needs NV, PA, and GA."
International betting odds has Trump at only an 8.3% chance of winning now. His paths are getting incredibly narrow.
"Statistically, sure, there are more than enough votes for him to take all of the remaining undecided states.  That's why they're still undecided.

Realistically, no, unless recent voting trends massively, massively shift in an unexpected way.  Biden is way overperforming what he needs to do to take Pennsylvania, and is in fact on pace to win by well over 100,000 votes.  He wins Pennsylvania, and the race is over.


Biden is also slightly above where he needs to be to take Georgia, although that one will be very close either way.

With Nevada, Trump is nowhere near pulling the numbers he needs to win, and the remaining votes are super heavily skewed to blue areas.

Arizona is the one place where Trump's trending numbers are just barely good enough to flip the state in his favor.  However, both Fox and the AP have stood by their calling the state for Biden, saying that the remaining areas are going to drop Trump below where he needs to be.

Trump must win at least 3 of those states, and one of those wins must be Pennsylvania, to have a chance.

"Yes, anything is possible at this point unfortunately. Unlikely by the hour Trump will win but not impossible."
Sadly yes it’s possible
[deleted]
Anything is possible in 2020
Absolutely possible.
Yeahh
Anything is possible
Yes.
"Yes.

By staging a coup."
yes
yes
he absolutely MUST win PA otherwise it doesnt matter what happens to the other states
"Yes, the outcome is still uncertain for right now, looking good for biden though"
Sadly it is
Yes. He can hold GA and PA and then snatch either AZ or NV.
"Yes - if he keeps GA and PA, and takes AZ. He's projected to lose PA and GA, but may gain AZ in exchange. If He loses GA (which has fewer votes than PA) and trades it for AZ, he still loses. He HAS to clean sweep all three to win."
Why do you think the race hasn't been called yet?
"Yeah, he would have to hang on to his lead in PA, NC, and GA then overtake in either NV or AZ. If Biden can clench PA (which seems very likely) then it is over, or if he can hold on in AZ and NV will EVER COUNT THEIR FREAKING VOTES!!!! its over."
It gives her tie-breaking powers.
"I was reading the same. Chuck grassley is the President pro tempore of the senate, but the constitution specifically states that the vp presides and the President pro tempore presides in their absence. This is the first officer who moderates and recognizes speakers. 


The majority leader having control of what gets voted on is supposedly tradition rather than law. I’m interested in hearing an actual legal or constitutional scholar weigh in, since my reading is from senate.gov and Wikipedia"
"I think if its a tie vote in the senate she has the final vote. But don't quote me on that. Honestly, I don't think VP's have a lot of power besides that."
"No, acts as a tie breaker."
"No, it is purely casting a tie breaking vote in the event of a tie. That’s it."
She gets a tiebreaker vote in the case of a 50-50 split.
He gets a tie breaking vote. That’s basically it.
The VP breaks ties in the Senate and only ties.
"Yes, she would break any ties"
"Yes. In the event of the tie the VP is the tiebreaking vote.

So if Biden wins and we win the double runoff in GA in Jan, control goes to the Democrats"
The Vice President casts a vote in the Senate in case of a tie.
One thing they can do is hold a tiebreaking vote
afaik only when there is deadlocks does the VP get involved in regular senate business
A tie in the Senate means she is the tie breaking vote.
"She can cast the tie-breaker vote if the senate is split 50-50. Beyond that, idk."
"No. The VP is ""President of the Senate,"" but they only break ties. The position is largely useless, hence the joke behind the popular HBO show Veep. In modern times they are used to shore up the vote in the General election and to act as a close advisor."
"No, only the Senate Majority Leader really has any power in procedural processes in the Senate. The VP's main function in the senate is to be the tie-breaking vote when needed. 

Other than that, their job is just to help out with whatever responsibilities the president gives them, like running certain task forces. They don't have a ton of stuff to do tbh, it's a nice job to have."
If it were tied
"Yeah the vice president has the power to vote in the senate (they typically don't afaik) usually it's to act as a tie breaker, but pence has utilized/abused that power way more often than his predecessors. If biden wins harris will have that ability."
"No, the vp can cast a tie splitting vote and can call a session. But, the majority leader decides what bills go to the floor and the majority votes on the rules."
Is Biden still outperforming?
Because the president of the United States screaming fraud doesn’t mean there is fraud. Statements from the president should not be unfounded “what if’s” believe it or not there are ways to determine these things.

A tie isn’t possible at this point since Biden picked up NE-2

A tie isn’t going to happen at this point. PA is gonna go to Biden.
"It’s just such an outside chance that it’s almost not even worth bringing up though.

GA to Biden and then Trump runs the rest of the board? Every contended state right now except PA would need to flip + PA would have to see a major shift in margins."
"Because its unlikely. Trump would have to win PA, AZ, and NV. And Biden would have to win GA. With the trends and outstanding ballots, its nearly impossible reality"

"""I don't know the exact number of provisional ballots, BUT my friend does tarot, she's fantastic, I can have her come up here and do a reading to see if we can get an approximation through the spirits""

*Marianne Williamson walks on stage*"
You right. You right.
GA looking good too
"If you swap AZ for PA, Biden wins even without NV."
I find it calming and reassuring
Oye I see you on the nyc subreddits
"They 100% would. ZERO uncertainty because Republicans will do anything to hold power. But it's not going to be that close. Biden will win AZ, NV, PA, and GA, with only NC going to Trump, making a comfortable margin."
Because most people want to keep breathing. Living is a powerful motivator
"Electors are chosen by the party. In an election like this, you can imagine they are going to choose very, *very* carefully."
Bidens gonna win PA it’s over
They will not. Joe Biden is not a threat to the establishment. Why would they risk it?
"Electors are chosen by the party that wins the state, there is not a single person that Democrats would choose to be an elector that would flip and vote for Trump"
"In the majority of states, the electors belong to the party who won the state.  They are typically high up in the party and have serious political clout.  This is not truly something to worry about."
It’s not going to be that close
"So, they can try, but there are laws in 32 states that prevent faithless electors from doing this that the Supreme Court has upheld as constitutional. However, only 15 of those states remove, penalize or simply cancel the votes of the errant electors. 

https://www.npr.org/2020/07/06/885168480/supreme-court-rules-state-faithless-elector-laws-constitutional"
"A lot of states have laws on the books forbidding faithless electors. I've also been watching a lot of interviews with AGs, etc. from the battleground states. They all seem to be pretty pissed off about Trump, the USPS, and anyone else interfering with the process. I don't see a lot of red flags from anyone outside of the immediate Trump campaign indicating there's a chance of something like this. But still, good to be cautious about it."
"AFAIK the electors are chosen by the party that wins the state, so in that case someone who was chosen by the Democratic party would have to not vote for Biden in December. 

The bigger risk for this election is a state legislature in a state that Biden wins basically deciding to temporarily abolish popular vote in their state, and choose the republican electors regardless of the statewide results."
"There's nothing preventing that aside from possible fines depending on the state. And electors are relatively unknown to the people unless you go looking, as far as I know. They're not shrouded in mystery, just not publicized.

We can only hope that doesn't happen. If it does, I hope the administration would be smart enough (not Trump specifically because what are the chances of that) to pick a state that's so close that it'd give them more of a leg to stand on (really more of a toe than a foot). It'd still be obvious what's going on but they could pick Georgia for instance. Probably close enough to go for a recount, a court case, or both when all's said and done. I could see an elector flipping to Trump if Biden wins there even if recounts and court cases don't go Trump's way on some emotional ""because it's Georgia"" bullshit. 

TL;DR there's nothing except a human conscience preventing it from happening"
Here's some good rational analysis about potential scenarios like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZWRhLW7Y8w
"Everyone said that Virginia was a mistake, but AP called it for Biden, even when Trump was leading 60% to 40%"
Cause the error isn’t enough to surmount Biden’s lead in the state
r/MadLads
Fox uses AP for their data.  So it's just AP
Cos they know the data. Right now everyone is just playing a game of chicken. They have held the decision after multiple push backs on it.
Bc they don't think it's a mistake.
Confidence. They think they did the math right. I’m quite sure they’re still closely monitoring it. One would presume they’re seeing what they expected to see.
"it would be a bad look, it's better for them to stick with it and see what happens"
because Their expert doubled down on it (Fox News)
"I guess because retracting it will still make them look bad, and if it turns out Biden wins AZ then they will look very good at predictions."
"The others are going by 538, also it’s not just AP and Fox, it’s Politico and NPR as well."
"Stats show right now that trump is averaging above the percentage he needs, but the rural counties are drained. He will not keep his numbers up as votes continued. 

AP has called this, doubled-down, and released an explanation why they are so sure (AZ will continue to be blue in the future, due to growing city centers, californian transplants, and latinos - AP noted the election of Kelly, Sinema, the condemnation of Arpaio, etc.)"
[deleted]
They either truly believe he has this or are praying and don't want to retract a call.
Everyone else is being careful and saying it's too close to call but AP and Fox believe all the votes that are soon to come will all go in Biden's favour. It's not really a mistake.
"They use different polling sources. One overestimated the count and fucked up basically, while the one the AP uses did not. Thus, it's a formality really, but obviously, until all votes are counted its not 100%. So, they're being cautious"
"> when everyone else says it’s a mistake?

Stop listening to everyone else. If the account is unticked (on Twitter), don't listen. 

If a ticked account says something, and it's just a celebrity, ignore it.

If a ticked account says something, and it's a stats or polling person, wait for confirmation - whether you like the news or not."
"They don't want to admit a mistake if they don't need to, especially since FOX doubled down on it after Kushner called."
You sound like a proxy system designed to give slave states more power is somehow a bad thing in a representative democracy.
And faithless electors to boost. Jfc
"No.  Nobody is hoping for that, even secretly."
Co-presidents!
"I like to imagine in a scenario like that, the reps of each state delegation will look at the vast popular vote margin, interpret the will of the people, and...vote along party lines.  Seriously, not even in my wildest dreams can I imagine Republicans actually caring what the American people want."
"Reminds me of a Veep quote:

Selina: Didn't those Founding Fuckers ever hear of an odd number?!
Ben: Two great Greek contributions to society: democracy and getting fucked up the ass."
Shouldn’t the popular vote then just decide in the event of a tie?
Don't even
Not likely
"Nevada is taking their sweet ass time, Arizona still hasn’t finished nor Georgia. Pennsylvania might end up finishing and calling it for Biden tonight."
"GA is within 10k, PA is under 100k separating the two."
"Georgia margin is ~9k, lowest it's ever been"
There are a lot of Republicans voting for Biden while still voting Republican down-ballot.
"Likely Republican/Independent cross-over to vote for Biden that voted for Perdue, not too surprising"
A lot of people voted for Biden and then the republican senate choice in order to “keep him in check.”
Some republicans may have supported Biden over trump.
This is the same thing that probably happened in Maine. Republican voters that were sick of Trump likely didn't vote D down the ticket. They voted for Biden or someone else and then voted for every other R on the ballot.
"Makes sense to me.  SOME Republicans have the spine and conscience to stand against Trump.  

I’d be curious to see how many Trump supporters who voted for the Democratic senator.  Probably not nearly as many!"
"Not really, there are a number of republicans who Do not like Trump, but still are republican ideologically.  While I’m not sure if that makes up the full 100k difference, it would definitely explain a decent percentage of it."
That’s just republicans that are sick of Trump. They vote Biden then red down the ballot.
"nah its almost certainly conservatives who hate trump for non-political reasons, but would still vote R"
Libertarians are also on the Georgia ballot so you might see some going there.
"The Libertarian candidate siphoned 112,000 votes."
"really likely at this rate. Look at the Georgia stats here: 

[https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html)"
98%
Only 9~k differce rn. So looking likely but is still a tossup.
"I would say at this point, more likely than not, but not by much. My gut feel is like 60% chance having been glued to results and analysis for the last 72 hours"
75% likely. In my subjective opinion.
"Biden needs around 64% of the remaining vote to win. Depends on where the remaining votes are coming from, but could be entirely possible if coming from the right areas. A GTech stats professor tweeted last night that he thought Biden would eventually overtake Trump in GA"
"More and more likely. 

An hour ago, PredictIt had GA at 70% Biden, it's now 81%.

[https://www.predictit.org/](https://www.predictit.org/)"
"[https://www.predictit.org/](https://www.predictit.org/)

&#x200B;

Biden is just about as likely to get GA and PA as Trump is to get NC."
"About 50%, it either does or doesn't"
"Called for Biden I assume you mean.

Trump really has like maybe 1%

PA is Biden, GA is probably Biden, AZ was called two days ago and isn’t changing, NV is Biden. Gg"
I think it’s somewhere between 300-500k
"There’s about 400K left to report, that includes counting"
400k votes left to count
Last mention on CNN was 340k left to count. Joe needed around 64-68%. He's been trending around 78% of all ballots counted today.
"In fairness, I'd be willing to bet she hasn't slept since Monday night."
Great show.
That was such a good show! It's a shame it got cancelled
"It seems there may also be a discrepancy between how many votes have been counted and how many votes are officially reported as of yet. I believe there's a process between counting the vote and when they get officially added to the tally. 

[At least according to this we are still waiting on ~430k votes](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html)"
Yes - and I read a stat last night that it was 9 Biden votes for every 1 trump vote so the odds are quite good. Sorry I don’t have a source this was hours ago
63%
"135/225 split, he would need 225/360 which is 62.5 percent? Unless im missing smth"
About 62.5%
"How do you get 70%? I get 64%. Also, he is averaging 75% for the past 24 hours, so I think we are ok, buy it isn’t a slam dunk."
"This was posted earlier:

It really isnt. President is the President until Jan 20. Only in America are we obsessed with getting the the results same day . Of course this isnt a normal election so were are all anxiously watching but there's absolutely no reason other then media pushing it that we need to know immediately and see big maps and expert break downs of random counties in the midwest
Sadly yes

Yes unfortunately
Yes
Probably later tonight once PA flips to Biden.
Tonight
Definitely by Christmas.
Some time in 2020
"Possibly later tonight if Pennsylvania is called for Biden. If not, maybe sometime tomorrow. Who knows."
Seems likely it’s Biden. Everything has to somehow go wrong for him. Just need more votes counted to be absolutely sure.
Tomorrow would be my guess.
It's more likely that he's gonna nuke pennsylvania than concede
"The closest thing we'll ever get to a Trump concession speech is him stating the election was ""stolen"" from him."
He would never do that
That's the least likely thing to happen.
Lol good one
"No, that's really not his thing."
trumps propganda machine.
Its kinda close but it has also been relatively steady percentage wise
"There was a small trump surge when the last of the in person votes were counted, people thought it would be a trend."
closeness and the state saying there are likely more republican votes left than anticipated
Rumors of the remaining ballots being from red areas.
The trend of the past couple of vote dumps. Its trending towards Trump but we dont really know
">everyone

Trolls, ignore 'em.

Really, ignore everything you read in here unless it links to a more credible source."
"Trends.

But there's also evidence that the next batch of votes might be more favorable to Biden.  

The bottom line is that it's super, super close and the end result will likely be decided by few thousand votes at most."

No one was expecting the makeup of the post Nov 2 drop off/mail in to slant as heavy Trump as it did so far. In hindsight if you understand the way AZ votes (permanent absentee ballot) it makes sense. The 7pm dump will help show if the pathway really exists for trump or if is a lock for Biden.
"Could've been a premature call by Politico, AP and Fox. Arizona might get close but close is good enough as long as Biden still wins it."

"Basically, Trump has got enough votes in the most recent drops to be on pace to come back and win the state (but the remaining votes *likely* aren't red enough for him to keep it up)"

Happy Cake Day!
fox has been anti trump for the past couple days
I did the same and that speech was wild in so many ways. Kind of hard to comprehend that it just happened.
What did he fail to predict?
"silver isn't making predictions though. he made a model that aggregates polls.  but they give plenty of caveats.  he says it's extremely likely biden wins. the biggest whiff is senate, but even that wasn't a sure thing."
"lmao Nate nailed it dumbass, a polling error towards Rs and dems still held and are gonna win MI PA AZ GA and WI, Nate was all over it"
He was right you just don’t understand statistics. Literally the last article he posted before votes came in was how this could very well be a nail biter. He gave the possible outcomes and this is exactly one of the outcomes he predicted.
"He gives you odds based on data. In 2012 he was on the nose. In 2016, he was one of the only people to give Trump an honest chance at winning. This year he got one state wrong and two of the four states he left as unpredictable are Georgia and North Carolina, both of which are still uncalled. 

He said Arizona leans Biden. He never said the state was a slam dunk. He's also one of the few to say Biden would get NE-02.

People need to learn that when someone gives you 100 possible ways for something to go and you decide that means massive victory, it isn't on the person making the prediction that your idea didn't happen, it's on you

[https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/?cid=rrpromo](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/?cid=rrpromo)"
"I mean, he was pretty spot on when it was all said and done. Smaller margins, for sure, but pretty spot on with the results."
"Nate Silver said there was only a 30% chance of a Biden landslide or a and only 10% Trump win. Neither of them happened. 

Nate's model said if there was a similar polling error to 2016 Biden would still probably end up winning."
If Biden wins GA and PA and AZ then he will have called the presidency and 48/50 states correctly
What should Pelosi have done?
"Idk, if Trump is not on the ticket, Rs don't show up, as we saw in 2018 (and 12 and 08)."
"Well, fortunately, the Republicans have gerrymandered the maps to such a degree that swings in voter turnout don't really tilt Congressional elections all that much."
There are more Democratic voters and independents than Republicans
I think without Trump on the ballot a hell of a lot of them will just slide back into apathy ... they didn’t show up in 2018.
There are 70 million Trump voters. That is not the same as Republicans. Who knows what the relationship between Trump and the Republicans will be at that point. Right now it seems to be deteriorating.

how many more votes left?
Biden''s margins still good?
"88 percent, not 95"
The AP is saying PA is at 88% reporting.  Where are you getting 95%?
"Neither has NYT.  It has to do with the demographics of the outstanding votes. It seems like Biden will prevail, but I certainly understand the need for more certainty."
"unless he dies, why shouldn't he? Generally, at least in more modern times, presidents tend to have long agendas that 4 years isn't able to generally solve in a single term."
It’s been widely assumed that he only intends to be a one term President. I’m not sure if he has explicitly said that though.
He's gonna be 82. I think it might be unlikely.
[deleted]
At 82? Unlikely.
"You have to search a bit but I think he said 4 years then retire.

I remember something like this so not verified :)"
One step at a time
Unless he is sick yes. It is not often in modern times a sitting US president does not run again. The last was LBJ I think.
Yo one thing at a time homie
"Cross that bridge when we get to it. This election isn't even official yet.

That said, I don't think he will. He's old already and will be 8 years older after 4 years. I'm ok with that, though. I hope he can set the table for a more progressive candidate to take over at that point. (Though let's be real, the Dems would push Kamala at that point)"
A lot can happen in 4 years but ye he do be kinda old. I think I heard it mentioned that part of why he picked Harris is that if it comes down to it he thinks she’d be a capable president
He's hinted at being a one term president. I think he seems himself as a way to get trump off and attempt to steer this country into a decent state then handing it off to someone more progressive hence him leaning to work far left policies into a middle ground.
He already said he won't be running again if he wins. He'll be setting up the next generation of leaders.
As long as he does the economy good and fixes the covid issue we have  I think those who were on the fence and voted trump will realize he isn't some fucking Marxist and flip to him in 2024.
Definitely a lot of bad faith.
Then states need to start counting mail in votes before election night. The ones that did are done.
"I mean, we definitely have bigger issues to deal with. Patience won't kill anyone."
That is because Republicans are against it. I think PA literally tried to pass a law to help this and weren't allowed to.

Scottsdale in Maricopa County. Its a big hub for Trump.
"It was called prematurely. Even if Biden holds on, we should all agree on that"
"I think Fox News was one of the only ones to call it, and have been chewing their nails ever since doubling down on that."
Biden lead tightening. Doesn’t mean it will flip back red
"It was called top early. They thought nearly all mail ins would be for Biden, but unfortunately they may have been a little off"
"Called by news outlets, not by AZ. Not all outlets called it. Ironically, Foxnews did."
AZ is not going to Trump.
I think because mail in ballots were counted first in AZ.
"it was incorrectly called a long time ago, whereas the smarter sites knew there'd be a Trump bump towards the end.  It's really too close to call, and the ones that called it should have retracted it when it became abundantly clear it was."
Counting ballots from a trump leaning county. There is Biden leaning county’s to count still.
They’re going to count a big dem county tomorrow

"some networks are being extra safe to milk ratings, NV AZ should all be called, PA's projection's not even a close race, it's just GA, biden's basically won."
"There was an explanation from AP - which I can't find now - saying that they had some insight into what's left to count, leading them to be confident in their call. Others are waiting to see what transpires.

Edit: https://apnews.com/article/ap-explains-arizona-joe-biden-bb16f91b04456b2513f40436248eb62d

Not quite what I said, really. They just seem to base it on Maricopa's initial trend. Idk."
"From my understanding, AP uses their own methodology that is separate from what the NYT used. AP has been doing this since the 1840’s with an unparalleled reputation."
"They never used the same data. Most people actually get there’s from the AP.

Both Fox and the AP stand by their calls."
They don’t want to call it wrong. Az will go for trump
Different models/different data
FOX called it too.
AP have had it called since yesterday. Same with Fox. They seem very sure.
They stand behind the call. Everyone else is waiting it out.
"IIRC, the AP is usually the first to have data, so they can call things earlier."
Fox has as well
"AP and Fox called it, the others haven't because it's a close race and they're more cautious so as not to have to retract it.

AP and Fox are standing by their call for Biden."
"I think it’s different sources, and some networks are more conservative than others when it comes to calling the states. NPR had called Arizona for Biden since yesterday."
Different sources.
"[Why AP called Arizona](https://apnews.com/article/ap-explains-arizona-joe-biden-bb16f91b04456b2513f40436248eb62d)

[Why NYT hasn't called Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/05/upshot/arizona-election-call.html)"
FOX was the first to call it at like 12:30 on election night
On this level it’s too hard to say. That is smaller than a statistical fluctuation.
"The problem with this analysis is they are using the total county spread to project the results. Mail in ballots are consistently bluer than the counties themselves, so this to me points to a Biden win."
That is possible but I think someone here said the recent batches for Georgia were coming from Trump districts.  That Biden's trend will return soon to take the lead.
That depends on if the mail in votes follow county vote trends or have higher Biden votes like mail in votes have shown both in Georgia and elsewhere. If Biden gets more votes due to being mail in then the estimates are too conservative and Trump might actually lose.
"Pretty sure your math is wrong, whatever it may be."
This is expected
Not by enough to matter
On Reddit or elsewhere?
"Biden won a new batch of votes from Cumberland County, Pa., by a margin of nearly 70 percent to 30 percent, narrowing Trump’s lead in the state to less than 80,000."
But AP and other sources show Biden in the lead in AZ?!
Very interesting point
You could start with a population tally and look at relocation trends to get the bounds of this. Youd then know whether this is worth exploring
You could also say covid screws with Republicans who lost their lives due to not wanting to wear masks and pretending like there wasn't a pandemic.
325k is more accurate. That's what the secretary of state confirmed as the number to use from their official website.
I came here with the same question
"Yea, the number goes down regularly because they’re counting votes. I wouldn’t read much into these minor differences until things shake out."
It may be the difference between counted and reported votes. Like they’ve been counted but haven’t been reported to any news media yet. But I’m not positive on that.
"Not likely. Would have to have state recounts first, then state courts, then supreme court. Doubt any of them will go that far"
"Nah, man. All of them but Barrett were very pro-mail ins. No way they flip on their own decisions"
They have no legal standing and should be tossed out immediately by the courts - ideally.
"It’s not likely. He has no basis, no proof of any election fraud. And he has to target a bunch of different states, all of which are being dismissed by state courts. State courts won’t entertain it, and SCOTUS is unlikely to take the case to overturn them. It’s not at all a similar situation to Bush v Gore, where there was an actual issue/discrepancy with how votes were being counted (and if it were, Trump is closer to Gore’s position, not Bush’s)."
You'd have to be more specific about which results you're asking about - different states have different mechanisms that could be challenged in court
"They have to challenge over something specific, not just ""the results."" For example, they may sue over ballots that arrived after election day, though they don't have much legal standing. Trump can't just ask the SC to change the results."
"They can't overturn the results.

They can demand a recount, and if the recount comes to a different conclusion that can change the outcome. (obviously).

But no Trump and the SCOTUS can not team up to change any of the results directly."
"Me, sometimes."
The same people who draw boobs in one line. Mind your business.
Seriously...everyone knows you're supposed to draw it as an S that just keeps going a bit longer.

"Then stop watching, take a bath, go and have a good meal or go outside for a walk. This is far from over and it is going to take a while, take care of yourself! If it is any consolation, the PA and GA numbers are looking great and the chances of Trump getting all required states are really low.

Nevada definitely.

Yes. Several news outlets have called Arizona for Biden and he's leading in Nevada

az by 73k

nv by 23k"
it's likely
he's probably got both lol
Nevada almost certainly and an excellent chance in Arizona
He almost for sure will.
yeah
Yes very good chance actually.  It would be shocking if he didn’t.
Arizona indubitably.
"Both, but Nevada is like 99%"
"Yes,  he is winning them lol"
Nevada is definitely biden's. AZ is a coin toss.
Yes. 100k of the outstanding Arizona vote is in Pima county which is much more blue.
"Yes.

The SOS knows he’s going to win
Yes.
Likely by 80-120k
He is going to win. Biden is earning 75% of a the vote from mail in ballots.
"He has a good chance,  but it'll be close."
We’ll know when they finish counting.
"If Biden wins the remaining votes left with the same percentage he’s been winning by with mail in ballots, he will win PA by about 90k"
No way to tell until they finish
Yes. It will not be that close
"If Biden continues his current pace, PA is his."
Hard to say but they still got tons of mail-in ballots still to count.  The Dems are optimistic because most of the mail-in left are pro-Biden and there are enough left for him to overcome the 90K deficit.
They are still counting
"Well, based off the 12k drop that just happened.....

Trump needs 57% of remaining ballots to win and currently is hitting 59% today.    


So if that trend were to continue, Trump would pull out Arizona."
"How does it keep looking like that?

Based on any realistic math involving remaining counties, it is obviously a Biden win."
On cnn they explained that the ballots they're counting now came in closer to election day which means they might lean closer to trump since trump people are more likely to believe early voting is bad. It's stupid but they are trump supporters.
Math says it’s impossible based on the ratios and current votes coming in being Biden mail in
Place your bets - trump AZ win is underpriced.

"What happened to ""He gets to pick his cabinet"" you heard from Republicans about every unqualified party hack and two bit campaign donor Trump put in charge of the government?"
If Biden thinks the way to move forward is by picking cabinet nominees off a Mitch McConnell approved list we are fucking doomed prior to the inauguration. What the fuck is wrong with him?
"Just appoint ""acting"" people like Trump did."
"> consider limiting its prospective Cabinet nominees to those who Mitch McConnell can live with

The same strategy that successfully added Merrick Garland to the supreme court. What could go wrong?"
"Its not likely to flip red at this point, but its possible. News wants you to stay watching so they make it seem closer than it really is. Trumps not winning the ballots in those counties by enough to pull ahead currently."
No chance.  No chance in NV either.
I have the same question
"AP and fox called Arizona for Biden Tuesday because outstanding votes are from areas where Biden won the vote (phoenix and some suburbs).

However, what's happening, is these outstanding votes are breaking for Trump anywhere from 51-70%.   I heard a talking head this is because the absentee/mail in split is even or even more trump because it's such a snowbird state and a lot of people have their primary residence there and this absentee/mail in doesn't split like the mail in in GA and PA."
"A lot of mail-in voters in AZ are republican. It is realistic that it could swing, but it A.) is not SUPER likely and B.) may not matter."
"Basically, in my opinion, which is just some dude looking at spreadsheets in front of a computer, it's got a decent chance of going red.  Better than 50% in my opinion."
Now that the orange king is dead it is time to clean our own house starting at the top.

No.

Not really. It has to go through the courts first.
They did in 2000 with Bush v Gore. That was in the recount though and was using old technology. Can't see that happening again.
SCOTUS can order anything it wants.
No they can't. They have no legal standing to do so.
No. This isn’t 2000. That was a recount. This is not a recount.
"I want to say no, but considering the bs they've put out lately, I'm uncertain."
Theyre all coming from very blue counties.
He's routinely been getting in each new batch
They’re all in counties where he’s already getting more than those kind of percentages.
"You are in MD, look what % went for Biden in Baltimore City or Howard County.  Probably close to 70%.  Same is true for other Blue Areas like Philly where these votes are from.  Add in that Dems were voting by mail at a higher % and you get 70 to 80% dem when opening these ballots."
" the remaining vote to be counted are from mail-in ballots, which were overwhelmingly democratic (78% as of right now)"
>because majority of mail ins are from dem voters due to both sides publicity and messaging re covid
Because Democrats told everyone to vote by mail and Republicans told everyone not to vote by mail. The mail votes are being counted last in these states.
Well one party takes COVID seriously. One party was told to vote by mail. One party was expressly told by their leader to NOT vote by mail.
"1 he's been pulling about 78% for most of the day already
2 philly and pittsburgh
3 don't worry, grab a drink and rejoice"
"It’s actually quite likely because the remaining ballots are mail-ins which are ridiculously skewed democratic. And they’re coming in from blue strongholds like Philadelphia, which already has 80% of its votes going to Biden."
"The remaining votes are mail/absentee ballots. Trump told his supporters not to use them, so there are barely any Trump votes in there."
John King on CNN just said Biden has been getting around 78 percent so far I think.
"Entirely depends on the county and the makeup of the ballots. Mail ins are more blue on average since trump asked his voters to go in person. If you add to that the votes being from a blue leaning area it's entirely possible to get a big lead in the mail ins.

Not saying it will happen, but it is entirely plausible"
"From what I understand, the mail in ballots (which are what is left to count right now) are disproportionately democrat votes in Pennsylvania"
By continuing to get 78% as he has for the last two days.
"The remaining votes are mostly mail-in, and Trump just spent the last few months telling his supporters that mail-in voting BAD. So they didn't vote by mail. So all the mail-in votes remaining are almost all Biden."
Because what is left are mail-in ballets. Democrats were way more likely to vote by mail because Trump told his cult to vote on election day.
Republicans don't trust the mail
"Because trump urged to go to the polls and not do mail-in vote, Biden urged going with mail in if that’s what you were most comfortable with. With coronavirus fears, it makes sense the majority of them are Biden"
He's been getting 70% + of the votes for nearly 24 hours - I think PA is closer to him needing 60% of the remainder now
"He's pulled 78% all day. The votes are coming from Philly, and they're mail in ballots. All good signs for Biden."
"Because the remaining ballots are all mail-in and in largely democratic areas.  Even the non-democratic areas, it's ALL mail-in ballot ONLY that's left, which were most of the time filled out by the democrats in those republican areas.

For the ballots that were opened today in PA, Biden has won 78% of them.

He's got this."
The remaining votes left to count are both mail in ballots which heavily skew democrat and also from high population democratic counties. Absolutely not a guarantee but definitely good signs
Historical trends hugely augmented by Covid.
Votes coming in the remaining locations have results at around 78% in favor of Biden
They're from areas that he's winning by that margin or higher and from mail in votes which he's winning by that margin or higher.
"The remaining votes are primarily mail in ballots from urban areas, both of which heavily trend Dem.  He's going to get more than 70% of those votes; 9 out of 10 for the Philly ballots."
Mail in ballots are often dem leaning.  And these are from a dem county.  So more so.
"Democrats didn't want to get sick or get others sick, so they largely mailed their ballots. The shit gibbon's followers grunted something racist and showed up in person to vote, so there's were already counted after the drool was wiped off their ballots."
Their statisticians disagree that it is uncertain
Because it denounces their credibility
"Fox's decision desk claims they are unwavering in their call. So they either actually have some solid reason to think that that many of us don't know of, or they just don't want to retract it because it will make them look bad and lose credibility."
"Well, why aren`t they calling Nevada, and the election then? 
Because they aren`t all that sure..."
"Probably because a backtrack would reflect really poorly on them, and if they are ultimately wrong, backtracking ahead of time offers no real advantage. They're probably just crossing their fingers right now hoping they were right"
Saving face. If Nevada is called they'll have no choice.
"I think networks want to avoid a retraction if they can.  As long as AZ is still ""uncertain"" and not ""likely Trump"", they'll keep it that way.

Edit: Also, if GA or NV is called, they can make a prediction before the other networks."
"It would look bad. Otoh if it doesn't go for Trump, they will look very good for calling it so early. Also, they obviously remain confident enough in it going for Biden that they are willing to take the risk of being wrong, but there is a heavy incentivization for them not to retract until a Biden loss in Arizona is probable."
"Hopefully we get to say

IT'S UNDER 9000!"

"Sort of. In the event that no candidate reaches a majority of votes in the Electoral College, the final decision is made by Congress. The House of Representatives decides the president among the top three candidates, and the Senate decides the Vice President among the top two."
I would think so
No
No
"I do, but apparently no one else does.  If Biden gets PA it doesn't really matter though."
Has there been any updates? It looks the same
No
Not really.
"yes, i think all these states are close and no one really knows how these different buckets of votes will play out or exactly how many there are"
not likely.
"It doesn't even matter because PA (and NV) is in his pocket, possibly GA too"
"It seems way too close to call, so yes"
No. His frivolous lawsuits are going to be just that. He's simply trying to bully a system that will not be bullied....not this time.
One step at a time
Damn you lol
"I don’t know about that, I think NY will be after him with a vengeance."
"He doesn't have any money though, and in a few months he won't have any power."
Counterpoint: he owes hundreds of millions of dollars and his power disappears the moment he's banned from Twitter
"The difference is, Trump actually committed his crimes. Never say never."
If NY finds something you are kidding yourself if you think they aren't going to go after him.

"They are scared. If they release the large bath they have counted, Biden will be declared winner, and trump will call on people to attack Philadelphia. I think all remaining states will coordinate and dump a lot of votes tonight so no single state is the clear tipping point."
"the question was about specific precincts, not the hold on ballots"
More like Endgame
"its more like the last jedi

just a fuck up"
I’m guessing 2016 was Revenge of the Sith?
Probably accidentally packed it in his carry on and it’s behind all his shit in the Penske.
What?!
Where are you seeing that?
"Oh fuck this shit, I'm going to bed."
Lazy MFers lol
Should get the bulk of Nevada by Saturday the 12th is when all votes have to be tallied. I’m sure it will be called before the 12th after this weekend while some votes will trickle in form the mail ins. Based on what they said in the press conference.
Theres always been these deadlines but they only matter now because of how close it is. In PA military overseas need to have ballots in by the 10th
Pennsylvania goes for Biden. Almost certainly will now.
he gets more votes than the other guy
Biden continues to win the states he’s winning right now and hits 270 - probably the most plausible outcome if he wins.
"90k votes left to count for Georgia, Biden only down 9k"
He'll win Pennsylvania easily
"He needs PA or any 2 of the other 4 states. 

PA seems to be the most likely. Arizona + nevada looks likely too"
"Plausible? He takes PA

That or Arizona and Nevada"
"Win PA (I think they will call PA before AZ or NV), or Win AZ and NV. GA could go to Biden also."
"yeah when they started talking about all of trumps ""accomplishments"" i changed it"
you lasted longer than I did.
"None at this point, don't worry too much about it. They already ruled on PA ballots so if it gets called not much Trumpy Dumpy can do"
PA
"None sensibly. Only on the bogus notion that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had no jurisdiction extending post-marked ballots for three days after election. Every state has the right to determine its own election rules. It's not federal whatsoever and they've declined to take it on twice.

But conservative SCOTUS now might be signaling it's ready to hear the case.

The death of checks and balances, basically."
Nevada holds Pennsylvania flips due to mail in big majority of EC
"If Biden continues to lead in PA mail in ballot voting like he has all day, he wins PA. He could even start doing a couple % points worse and still win PA. And if he wins PA, he wins the presidency. This thing’s just about over"
The votes left to be counted all come from areas that should heavily favor Biden.
It is predicted that the number of democrat mail in votes compared to republican democrat votes outweighs the gap in PA. It is predicted that the number of mail in votes left in Nevada are majority democrat. Biden only needs ONE of any of the remaining states to win. He has won. Trumps offspring shitting their pants on Twitter is proof that Biden has won.
Absolute 0. He will though complain like no other...imagine if the race is called mid rant and reporters erupt to ask him about it lol
O\_o
Please say he didn't say that
"I’m signing one now that says we keep counting, so there!"
I honestly can’t tell if this is a fake quote
I'm gonna hold you to that.
Cool. Enjoy your meal.
"Yeah, wondering the same."
CNN

"Nah, he speaks because he can't help himself"
"FOX too, but the point is well taken"
Fox called AZ as well
He spent too long in the wolf-dream
"Because he's blinking so much?

Probably wind + bright lights."
"No, Biden could underperform with the remaining ballots by a full 10 points and still win comfortably."
"At current % pace Biden would win by 40,000 votes"
"Only mail-in remaining in Philly that is overwhelmingly (85%+) for Biden

This won't be even close at the end"
"No, PA Biden will win by a much larger amounts than other close states. He could win by as much as 100k by some counts."
"current projection have biden with over 100,000 lead so... not that close. the only reason it isn't called is that they want to make sure the whole thing is counted and transparent and that trump cannot contest it seriously (he will contest it, he already is doing so)"
"Update, you are more motivated than most people"
"AZ tightening a bit for Trump, PA tightening super fast for Biden, GA at 9k lead for Trump and it'll be a photo finish. Trump giving a conference in 8 minutes"
turn on the news in 8 minutes and watch the fireworks (or waterworks)
Trump gonna make an announcement at 6:30pm ET
Trump speech in 10min
"PA may give us a good idea by 10pm EST. The state is rapidly going to Biden. 

Trump speaks at 6:30 EST so... expect some crazy shit."
"GA and PA are getting tighter for Biden. 35k Allegheny county PA votes won't be counted until tomorrow.

Trump is about to call for civil war/seize power in a press conference in 7 minutes."
Dipshit speaks at 630

Why is this tough? It shouldn't be. My vote is PA.
I'd say PA but both. And NV.

Because he isn’t losing AZ quickly. Most likely not slowly either.
"And less than 4,000 away from flipping. It will be close.

It's like Texas. Even if they stay red it's a sign it won't be that way for long."
CNN could be getting information that's incomplete tho.  Like only x number of ballots left BUT that's after vote totals that haven't been updated.
to count? prob not posted
To count and to report are different.
github site is pulling from the NYT API. The estimated votes remaining changes frequently.
Maricopa Co. is not as blue as most urban centers.
Fraud 🙄
Absentee ballots delivered to election officials in person uo to and weekend before election. Trump and biden supporters did this as it closely resembles both mail in and in person voting
Read it was from Mojave County
Republicans magically found more ballots somehow.  Cheaters and scum of the Earth.  Biden has thousands of lawyers ready.
"Because to win, he needs 58% of the mail-in ballot. He is averaging at 72%."
He needs 58% of the remaining votes and he's averaging 72%. The last votes counted are mail in and those are mainly dems
"Please watch the news they have explained it at least dozens of times now. 

Long story short: they are counting mail-in ballots and those are 60-80% democrat. With over 250k votes remaining and only a 64k lead for trump it is maths. Now we will have to wait and see if this trend holds up."
The trend
The amount biden is winning vs. How many ballots are left
"https://i.imgur.com/K8ymi1h.png

Basically that"
"McCaskill was basically saying this last night on MSNBC, what a joke"
Nobody is blaming the left...
"Like Gideon? ""Yeah, so Mainers really like people from Maine, lets get someone from Rhode Island and have her run, that'll work"""
"I mean, I still think it's really arrogant to somehow think you KNOW that a more leftist candidate would have done better in either case. Like, there's no evidence for that."
"I definitely blame the 'left' for swallowing every bit of republican propaganda from the past 20 years hook line and sinker and then pretending they are somehow objective...

If it looks like a duck, and ducks like a quack or something"
"Yea, but you'd be missing out on watching a guy named Wolf fucking Blitzer"
"If you get CNN+, it digitally replaces Wolf Blitzer with a wookie like newscaster with Wolf Blitzer's voice."
"Watch on Fox News, they are fun to watch right now."
Fox News if you want to see them call PA for Biden and make Trump super pissed
Just watch the map and listen to a podcast.

WaPo?
He's just old and has been doing this non stop for 3 days
John King's stealing the show anyway. Wolfie is just giving him a moment to blink.
Biden gets all 4
I think we may get GA too
Biden might lose Nevada. He probably isn’t losing Arizona. He’s only 9k away from Georgia.
I think GA goes to Biden and AZ will be ridiculously close
i bet AZ is called for biden tonight
AZ will not be called tonight unless it is an overwhelming number for Biden that comes in at 7. If Trump ultimately does win AZ it won’t be until the last votes are counted.
"Trump won't get AZ.  1st of Trump SHIT on McCain.

"No presidential runoffs, just recounts."
"No. But there are recounts possible, and likely."
"no, it’s winner takes all"
"No presidential runoff, but I wouldn't be surprised if there's a recount."
"No, no runoffs for presidential races."
You are making this up.
"You’re imagining things

We will have run offs for our two senate races though."
Not for presidential elections.
Only for the Senate. The presidential election results can at most he recounted
"IIRC, candidates can contest the results for a recount. It may end up happening in GA if Biden takes the lead."
That's not a thing.
Think it can just be a recount if it’s close enough and either group requests it
"No, there’s not a runoff for president."
"No runoff, but there likely will be an automatic recount (given the margins)."
You're making this up.
"I believe if its within 0.5% they have a presidential danceoff, but I could be making this up."
We do not.
I belive its just whoever has the most votes win. I don't think you need a majority
they do an auto recount if its within a small margin
Runoffs are only for state races
You’re making it up. They are talking about a senate runoff.
"No, no, and you're making that up"
AZ is irrelevant unless GA and PA stay red. Blue GA or PA takes the country for Biden
"No, Biden only needs PA or AZ/NV"
Where do you see that outlook?
yes unless one of the other states flips. Id say it could go red but the chances are slim. Am Arizonian
"Biden is polling excellently in PA and GA right now so getting Arizona may be inconsequential. 

But getting as many states blue as possible is definitely the goal"
If he gets Pennsylvania he doesn’t need arizona
"Biden needs to win PA

Or

Two out of GA, AZ and NV."
"If Biden wins Nevada and Arizona, and nothing else, he just gets to 270. It looks like he won Nevada already, but if he loses Arizona, he can win PA or GA and be fine."
If PA flips (looks likely) its over regardless.
"If you’re looking at the count of 264, then yes, it includes AZ. I wouldn’t panic until the AP or Fox switch the state to a toss up. Their voter data is more accurate than what is available to most other stations. The remaining ballots come from heavily democrat favored areas (Phoenix and the suburbs). 

If Biden wins, PA, it’s all over. And Georgia looks to still be on the table to flip."
"I think Biden will win Arizona, his lead increased today, but yes, if he looses it than he is 17 votes away (I think)"
"If joe Biden wins Pennsylvania, that’s it.

He wouldn’t need AZ, NV, NC, or GA. 

There are 29 paths for joe Biden.

There are 3 for trump. (According to NYT)."
"With what he's officially leading in, yes he needs Arizona. But if he gets PA GA or NC, he doesn't need AZ"
Lol Arizona is called. It’s not mathematically probable for Trump to catch up.
"With Arizona, Biden needs +1 other state. Without Arizona, Biden needs +2.

So NV+PA or GA+PA or NV+GA"
"Biden is currently at 253 without Arizona - most are using this total, only a couple of places called Arizona for Biden earlier. Biden is still ahead in Arizona, but the gap has been narrowing and it's possible that Trump could overtake him. There are still a reasonable number of votes left to count and recent updates have been giving more votes to Trump, but it's pretty unclear at the moment.

Pennsylvania is worth 20 so that alone would take Biden over 270 regardless of Arizona. Failing that, he needs 2 out of Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia. Nevada is almost certain for Biden but the other 2 could still go either way."
"He's already said he is retiring from politics. Not running for governor. Happy as a Pennsylvanian, because Wolf has been great."
He's not. He announced he's going for neither in 2024. Probably has a cushy lobbying job lined up.
He's up first for reelection in 2022
Fox and AP have called Arizona for Biden. Others have not. That's the 11 vote difference.
Arizona
Fox Called Arizona super early
They called AZ a long time ago. So did AP
Arizona
They have Biden winning AZ
They called it on Tuesday night.
They have maintained their AZ call
Some outlets have called AZ. Others are holding off.
They've had him there with AZ. No?
They gave him AZ like 2 days ago lol
Fox called Arizona on election night
Fox has AZ called
They have AZ for Biden.
They gave Biden Arizona ages ago
They have already given AZ to Biden.
"ADZ, two days ago"
Arizona
They have called Arizona for Biden since Tuesday night.
Fox called AZ for Biden last night and have decided to stick by it
Fox called Arizona on election night for Biden.
They were the first to call AZ yesterday
"It’s been called that way for awhile now. Some outlets didn’t call Arizona, but it looks like Biden for sure has that in the bag."
They’re sticking with AZ being called
They've been calling AZ for him for a while now
They called AZ on election night for him. AP called it the next day. They haven't moved from it.
"They called Arizona early, along with AP."
🤦‍♂️ Fox called Arizona almost 48 hours ago
They called AZ (11 EV) for Biden on Tuesday night. That’s the difference. AP also made that call. Other networks/media have not.
The AP called Arizona days ago. FOX followed suit.
they called arizona early yesterday
They’ve had it that way since yesterday afternoon by calling Arizona
AP and Politico as well have given him Arizona since yesterday
"Arizona was called awhile ago by the AP and Fox. They've both doubled down on it, too"
Some betworks called Arizona for Biden a while ago and have him at 264
They called Arizona a long time ago. Most have not though
They've literally had AZ called for a couple days now. The AP has done the same. Nothing new.
They called AZ already.
arizona fox and associated press called AZ for biden other news outfits didnt
"It's Arizona. Only Fox and AP called it, but have tripled down and stood firm."
"Fox called Arizona for Biden, like AP. But currently it's still unpredictable, likely premature calls. Still looking solid for Biden tho"
"Fox and AP have had Arizona called for Biden since early yesterday, it’s a controversial call that other places haven’t made yet but they stand by it"
az yesterday
They've projected AZ- perhaps a bit prematurely. Unless they know something we don't....
They called Arizona 2 days ago
I think they called Arizona yesterday and no one else has (except AP.)
Arizona
"They've had him there for a while, they called AZ on Tuesday night/Early Wednesday morning"
Fox has had him at 264 since yesterday. They count arizona while others aren't
They called Arizona yesterday.
They’ve called AZ for Biden since late Wednesday. AP has as well. They’ve doubled down every time they’re asked. They must have some data.
Fox and AP and no one else call AZ for Biden a long time ago No consensus on whether that was smart or foolish.
They called Arizona on Tuesday night and haven’t taken it back
"AP called AZ for Biden, Fox News uses the AP to determine if a state should be called"
They called AZ on Tuesday
"Fox and AP called Arizona a day ago, while everyone else is saying it's still too close to call"

"Depends IMO. If the Dems don't get the senate here and the R's are in a battle in 2022 to hold seats, I can see the SCOTUS holding off on something that big until after 2022. That way they can appear more impartial and get the pro-choice people to get complacent by pretending to be more even handed."
What really!?
Which is why we need to win the majority in the senate.
"He'll just have an ""acting"" Treasury Secretary. That's what Trump has been doing."
Interim positions?  Worked for Rump.
Then Biden should just do a bunch of temporary appointments like Trump did.
"Bold of you to think the every appointee won't be ""acting-XYZ"" because McConnell won't even show up for 2 years"
So cabinet members need to be confirmed now? Can’t Biden just do what Trump did and fill the cabinet with acting members?
"Eh, honestly they’ve been pretty left leaning recently. It’s not because they’re social justice warriors or anything, it’s just that what makes money and what’s good for the economy these days aligns with left leaning values."
What in the entire history of Bidens record and economic platform could make you possibly believe he's considering someone progressive for that post?

"> I’m honestly fine with voter fraud hurting Trump

Just no."
Don’t say stuff like this
"Cool your heels Don Jr. They're government officials and volunteers working on a shoestring budget trying to count an unprecedented number of mail-in ballots, some of which haven't even arrived yet.

You should be kissing their ass, not chapping it."
it wont matter if PA gets it's shit together
Is that the state where casino ~~monsters~~ tycoons live? That's what I understood from movies.
I knew it from the jump. It’s not a coincidence they’re holding out. This whole thing was already won and here we are waiting.
"It's more likely that they don't want to call it because it would put Biden over 270. If AZ flips (and it's not out of the question), the last thing we need is someone winning then having their win revoked. So they won't call it until they're certain Biden has a path to victory."
I told my wife it would make sense that they've been told to hold their numbers because a few places have AZ to Biden and some dont. If Nevada came out blue those networks would have to call it or retract AZ
Thats a big accusation source?
this is cute. Dont matter though. It looks bad to be on the wrong side of history
And Trump is behind. Lol

Threads that get too large can cause issues with the Reddit servers.
Because there is a limit to the number of comments in a single thread
"one advantage is that it helps stop trolls/misinformation by resetting the content people are viewing each time they log on. hard for a rumor (""michigan flipped red!"" was common last night) to catch on if it cant snowball"
It wont matter Biden is going to win by roughly 100k they wont get that many thrown out if they could
"Don't quote me on this, but I believe those have been set in a separate pile and are not included in the current count.  I think I read that some where... but I'm a bit delirious."
Those ballots have been set aside. They aren't included in current counts and probably will only be counted if Trump thinks they will help his chances.
Commenting because interested. LMK if you hear anything.
Yes. The PA Secretary of State is having those ballots held and not counted yet in anticipation of a court battle. They'll only be counted once it's ruled OK.
Best to follow betting lines Right now you'll get a cent on a dollar if Dems win and 30 dollars on a dollar if GOP takes the house.

No
Hell no. Hillary has absolutely no chance of ever being POTUS after 2016.
Fuck no. Hilary was the worst choice possible in 16 and would have been even worse this year.
"No way. So many trump voters in 2016 voted because of Hillary's blatant political-ness. Biden has the ""everyman"" thing that appeals to people - be it true or not."
"God no.

Trump would have destroyed her in 2020."
"You can look to 2016 for your answer.

Which is no."
not at all
"No. Sadly Hillary is just too tainted to people thanks to some mistakes, fox News, Russia, and sexism."

No. The remaining ballots are from a very historically dem heavy county.
"No. Stats show right now that trump is averaging above the percentage he needs, but the rural counties are drained. He will not keep his numbers up as votes continued. 

AP has called this, doubled-down, and released an explanation why they are so sure (AZ will continue to be blue in the future, due to growing city centers, californian transplants, and latinos - AP noted the election of Kelly, Sinema, the condemnation of Arpaio, etc.)"
I love your username. I feel like Fox and AP called it way too early. I’ve been mostly following CNN for John King but seems like they and MSNBC may have made the right decision to hold off because it’s so close.
No
Still feeling fine about it considering AP stands by the call
"It's going to be close as fuck.  More Republicans voted early in AZ than in most places, because AZ has a history of early voting (basically when you get a driver's license, you get asked to sign up for permanent early voting) so they were less likely to listen to Trump's bullshit about voter fraud.  Everywhere else has early votes leaning Biden heavily, but news stations underestimated the Republican split in AZ."

No there's 380k votes left biden needs at least 60% of them to win and he's been consistently getting 80%
No
He has steadily gained on Trump and we still have 11% of the vote to count it's still too early to count out either side.
Go claim the old thread. You can do that now.
Why do you sound like thats an insult to you or something lmao. So indignant for no reason
I'm so nervous to ask.... who?
he can appoint acting cabinet members like Trump did
I think trump showed the country how to get around all of this.
Not at all
Probably.

Biden jumped from 18k behind to 9k behind in Georgia in just a few hours and from 150k to 90k in PA.
Check the GA and PA counts. Big changes.
"If Biden wins AZ and NV, they can drag it out but it won't change."
What about if Biden wins in all current states other than Arizona? I don’t see that being drawn out.

We tend to call these 'collaborators'
But how many of those were there?
"I mean, here's hoping it's fruitless at this point"
I've never seen a group of people more dedicated to not allow ballots to be counted for any reason whatsoever.
the last dump in arizona was good
"AZ should stabilize, only counties bleeding right now are moderately rural, there still a bunch of votes outstanding in Urban centers. 

Will be close though. Not that it matters Biden gonna get PA for sure, and GA is looking good.

(and technically Texas and NC still in play too)"
"Actually AZ looking good again according to 

https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html"
"lol, not as worried as the trump family is about Biden's DOJ."
"If Fox refuses to budge on it, then I'm less worried that I normally would be. They've had Jared Kushner try to make them change Arizona. Chris Wallace asked their decision desk today, and said they would ""not waver"" in calling it for Biden. If it were anyone else, that wouldn't mean as much. 

But Fox's decision desk is going against their own wishes. They are going against pressure from the White House, their own talking heads, and (presumably) their employers. So guessing they have some confidence in their calculations there.

That said, I'm going to be worried about it until it's called by everyone."
As in not too much because we are going to win PA and GA
"still confident, Trump isn't getting enough in these latest batches to catch up. Also, just the fact that it's been called by multiple outlets is huge; it would be crushing for them to release retractions."
Given the small incremental changes with each [updated report](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html) it seems like it's safe for biden
"I actually don't know why people are so adamant that Arizona is still a toss up, can someone enlighten me?"
It’s a Qanon theory.
" Conspiracy theory bullshit

Sorry Qanon bullshit"
"Conspiracy trash, ignore it."
I'm certain whatever it is is a lie.
Conspiracy nonsense
"If you bothered to actually look at that instead of fear mongering, you'd see it's barely moved all day. So there's literally nothing concerning in the least."
"We've known that some of the later mail-ins were going to lean Trump, but we've also heard that some of the very last ones are going to lean independent and Biden should lead there."
"Biden is more ahead of the curve in GA and PA than Trump is in Arizona, and most of what left favors biden."
Has anything changed today?
Also NV looks very good
"https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1324219729595289601?s=20

Get rid of everyone.  We need to start over.

She's not wrong. You have to do things gradually.
Well rip those 2 seats

"I'm gonna fucking scream.

Dems: *run a very centrist, boring, old white man candidate and are BARELY winning over trump*

Dems: clearly this shows we shouldn't be progressive and should bow down to fascists

Trump literally got MORE votes than last time... Have any of them ever stopped to think ""huh, maybe the centrism is the issue?"""
"A lot of the recent count updates have favored Trump, but there are still many unreported votes from areas that are predicted to favor Biden."
I think it is flipping and I am scared
Not likely. But not impossible.
Who doesn’t? Mine smell like little puffs of breath from the gods
No. They still pay taxes.
"I get the sentiment, but defunding is not the way to go, it will generate more hate. We need to keep working together as a united nation where every county matters no matter how they lean."
Are you high? ... oh
He ain't trump though.
"Nah, cause some of us live in those counties that voted for Biden too."
No. That’s the type of bullshit political move that Trump constantly threatened. It’s exactly one of the problems we all voted against.
"Huh, thought they'd never give up"
Lmao. Crazy ain’t it
Hee hee hee
I'm melting. Thanks for that
I was so happy to finally get a link to a Fox News meltdown....
The lead is under 10k votes
It's not a miracle. It's just math.
I feel better about PA than I do about GA
He's down just under 9k voted with 40k absentee ballots left to count from mostly blue areas. It ain't over yet.
I think it will be close but I don’t think he will win GA
"Absolute, complete fucking toss up. No one knows."
Why? It seems like the vote he needs is still out there.
He's been getting 70% every count drop. He needs 60% to win.
Yup. I think the question is the 8k military and overseas ballots. I'm not sure if those are in the current total left or they are waiting on them coming in. Biden likely wins by like 2-5k. Those 8k could make it even closer
He’s been hitting the % of mail in he’s needed
He could win GA if the current trend keeps up.
It looks promising. He only needs around 61% of the remaining mail in ballots: https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html
Waiting on Savannah.
"If current voting trends continue, Biden will win GA."
"It's *very* close right now -- Biden is trailing by roughly 8,000 votes (out of a total ~5 million ballots counted). And since the mail-in ballots yet to be counted tend to lean Democratic, it's possible he could take the lead at the last minute.

The big question is how many ballots are still left to be counted; I haven't seen recent numbers on that."
He's the heavy favorite now under 10k vote gap
"Is this just based on your gut? That's fair, by the way, it's just not clear"
"23 minutes ago

* Trump +9,525
* Remaining 43,645 
* Biden is averaging 69.9%
* Biden needs 60.91% of those remaining"
The demographics in the places still being counted lean like +17 Biden. He’s been picking up ~70% of the incoming count and he only needs like ~62%.
Actually it's looking like he's gonna win it by 5k-10k votes.
"https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html

The rate he needs is lower than the rate he's getting. If it holds, Biden flips it and may end up winning the state by 7000 votes."
"He's killed more people with drones than Obama did in 8 years

Lmao Google it"
"He’s not at all though. We dropped more Bombs, one more civilians, in more countries in 4 years of Trump than 8 years of Obama. I don’t know how this narrative became gospel but it’s not true."
IIRC Trump has done pretty much the same amount/if not more warring in the Middle East as Obama but he just classified more of it — stopped publicly reporting drone strikes and such
Anti-war? Remember earlier this year when he assassinated an Iranian official?
Ignoring the fact that he drone striked more than Obama in 8 years and then legislated that he doesn’t have to disclose them anymore
Anti war except he assassinated an Iranian general and almost started a war for no fucking reason.
"Don't necessarily agree, he ordered the assassination of an Iranian General under false pretenses of an ""imminent threat"" which caused extreme tensions, retaliatory bombing of US bases, and an accidental shooting down of a Ukrainian aircraft which killed 176 passengers."
I hope so too!!
Murdering generals while trying them it's a peace talk and bone saws is more Trump's style.
We were pretty close to invading Iran at one point.
He just drone bombs foreign heads of state at civilian airports
"I'm not sure he's anti war when he kept deliberately trying to rile up/threaten other nations. ""My button is bigger than your button and it works"", threatening Iranian cultural sites, etc."
"He's not anti-war, he had a top Iranian general assassinated. He just couldn't get the Pentagon to sign off on nuking a hurricane LOL"
"That's ironic, considering Trump has just tweeted calling for ""total war"" over this election."
"Anti-war? The CIA black sites were never disbanded, there are plenty of soldiers and contractors in Djibouti, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, etc...there’s no such thing as an anti-war American president, sorry"
Not surprising from ol Bone Spurs tho
Same.
Even a blind squirrel finds a nut every once in a while.
He’s only anti-war because it’s currently convenient
Did Obama/Biden go to war during 8 years?
Didn't Trump almost start WWIII just earlier this year by going against his advisors and ordering a hit on another country's general inside an airport?
"Trump isn't anti-war, he just never had the opportunity to start one and get away with it. He was egging Kim Jong Un on hard."
"I also don’t mind that he puts some pressure on NATO to balance contributions. Not nearly enough to balance out the bad, but some policies are worth consideration."
Agreed. Thought he was going to go to war against Iran for a while there though...
The dude literally ordered the assassination of a foreign general... Not very anti-war of him.
"That's because the Republicans have singled out China for their Big War, and really don't care to mess up the Middle East anymore than it already is, but they do arm Saudi Arabia to the hilt."

"A machine is reading it, not them. Can't erase pen."

Idk but I’d guess they’re double/triple checked
Going to prison for a very long time.
[deleted]
Jail
The threat of life in prison?
lots of poll watchers
Lots of things. Try doing some research yourself. I bet you could google it in about a minute.
That is a dumb question.
They’re filmed
"it's a scanner, he just puts it there"
Felony prosecution.
"Votes are marked in pen and read by machine, at worst they could make it invalid"
They dont work alone
There are people there to make sure that doesn't happen also that the ballots get scanned into a system (I believe)
People who's whole job it is to watch them.  The cameras pointed at them in PA.
They scan the ballot through a machine typically. Also there are observers from both parties present
"Like 10 checks along the way haha. Ballots are scanned for tracking, multiple poll workers both dem and rep view the same ballot. The fact that poll workers are sworn in and violations are felonies."
Poll watchers and other security and monitoring measures.
"All the people watching them, it would be obvious what they are doing.  Also like jail probably."
peeople watching.  despite what fox news say there are poll watchers from each party in there watching everythign they do closely.  hell there are livestreams from in the rooms some places.
They'd have to remove ink from the dots and fill in their candidate while in front of overseers and observers
Their work is checked by officials from both parties.
"The law. There are securities, such as using ink to Mark the ballot. If more than one acceptable bubble is filled in, it invalidates the ballot (like both presidential candidates for instance or both yes and no on other questions)."
Do you think no one has considered this possibility since 1776?
it’s scanned in a machine
"They are being watched, and I imagine pens and pencils are forbidden."
There are (legally registered) watchers and oversight for these counters
"Jail. And each ballot has 2 poll workers, one R one D."
"Jail. And the R, D, and Independent watchers that are in the room with them"
A machine counts the vote. Workers simply open envelops and very signature and prepare for machine to count
"Election officials, observers, cameras, threat of prison time."
Being observed by another poll worker from the opposition party.
i don't think they're taking a tally on a bar napkin dude
Even if the voting isn't done on a computer. It is done using giant scanners and counted by computer.  They usually have numbers or barcodes to track and account for the ballots while still keeping them anonymous.
Because an R and D volunteer both count the same ballot.
"> This is a dumb question, but what's stopping a poll worker from changing votes while counting...?

Apart from being charged with a Class IV felony by the federal government? 😬"
"The other poll workers, supervisors from the republican, democratic and independent parties. Probably a few more things too."
"I don't know there, but here the votes are counted by all parties, or with members of all parties present."
"Not a dumb question. In the counting rooms are many republican and democrat aligned 'observers' (I don't think there are any Kanye aligned observers, but things are crazy enough right now that it wouldn't surprise me)"

"AZ moving toward trump, but Biden still in the lead. GA and PA moving toward Biden, but Trump still in the lead (for now). Just very narrow margins all around right now"
The results are narrowing in the states that matter.
"They’re narrowing in PA and GA, too."
"he's won 78% of the votes counted today, and he doesn't need the full 70% to win it"
"PA is breaking 80% in person 90% mail in, in favor of Biden via NBC"
"He’s already getting votes higher than that percentage though, and the votes left are mail in/early and primarily in Dem counties. Very possible for him"
It's not 70% it's like 62 lol
He's been getting 78% today
"60.5% needed

[https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html)"
It's 70% to win by 40k. He can still win with less.
He only needs like 60% to carry the state
"Great, he doesn't even need that."
thats to win by 40k. hes been exceeding 70% all day anyway
Except he's been getting 80%+ in the counties with outstanding votes.
Yeah that concerned me as well
No. Not worth it.
I could consider this if he agreed to marry Carole Baskin also
lol no
Trunk
That’s a pair of losses if I’ve ever heard some.
All of that sounds terrible
"so does Cuomo, that handsome bastard"
Not Savannah
Macon? Muscogee?
Those are wrong. Secretary of state says there are still around 41k votes to be counted.
"Because it’s all mail in vote which, regardless of county, has been about 3:1 for Biden."
"The ballots being counted right now are through mail and those are more skewed towards Biden. Only time will tell though and with the fine margins that will probably be shown, GA might be a recount."
I'm seeing different figures from all over the place. Ranging from 100%-93%
"The largest county by far appears to outweigh many of those smaller counties and heavily leans Joe, its not over yet"
"You have no reason to pay attention to AZ at all. It's blue, and if it wasn't blue, it wouldn't impact Biden's chances at all as long as PA OR GA are in play. Those are the races that are gonna win us this one."
It wont. Relax
"PA is within 80k, as long as the trend continues, Biden wouldn't need AZ or NV in that case."
"I think the AZ numbers are just hitting a funny bump. I read that there were about 100k mailin ballots from the day-of and the day before that are all being counted now. Those are much more Trump friendly. Then the 200k+ batch after that are the mailins from much earlier, which heavily favor Biden"
what counties ??
"Yet, he only gained just under 3K, Biden still holds a 65k lead."
Which areas though? If they coming from red area then yes obviously. Lots of votes to go and lots of blue areas to count up
"See from where the ballots were released, before making any assumption"
Ah hell
depends where.
"yeah, Trump is trending up in AZ. Unless theres a big Biden surge, he'll likely take it at 99%"
Those votes are admittedly from a more conservative county. The real story is Biden overperformed for that county.
"Can yall AZ doomers be quiet and stop regurgitating the same BS, thanks."
Doesn’t matter when PA is called for Biden.
That's why a lot of news agencies haven't called az. If Biden wins PA it doesn't matter.
"If that trend calculation is accurate ethen Biden has PA and GA in the bag. 

So, eh? Who cares. If Arizona flips we already have the election from PA and GA and Fox News looks stupid on top of being desperate."
"It doesn’t look safe, looks like it’s going to Trump just slightly. But we also are getting pretty shitty numbers they’ve only counted like 1000 ballots today"
I think there's uncertainty over what the vote mix left in Maricopa looks like. AZ does almost exclusively mail-in so there's not an easy way to predict remaining vote shares like in other states.
[deleted]
Wait until Maricopa starts dropping it's votes.
"No, you're right. The outlets are assuming that the outstanding ballots will favor Biden, but I'm not sure what information they're using to make that projection."
The unbiased truth has never been fox news
the unbiased truth is that not a single person on the internet has shown even a slight example of voter fraud or improper handling of votes. feel free to prove me wrong.
"> What's the unbiased truth?

Believing what you see on Fox news will be bad for your mental health."
"Poll watchers are people who watch peope vote, both campaigns can watch the votes being counted"
Is it?  It looks basically the same to me
shush bb its ok
How can we be certain
Username checks out lol
Hallie Jackson. Ooogiddy boogiddy
The real hope is that Arizona can fuck off and do whatever they want because PA flips
Fox isn't wavering.
Unlikely
I trust AP
Yes. But highly highly improbable.
"It’s possible. It’s not likely, but it’s possible."
lolwut? Only 3K difference with ~50K votes still left.
Are you ok? Lol. It was BEAUTIFUL for biden
They were great! Heavily Trump favored county went Joe's way
[deleted]
"Do you mean the 17,356 change?"
"He's doing fine. Still way above the necessary percentage, lots of votes left to be counted."
Gerald Ford was never elected.
"I don't agree with anything you said beyond Biden will be declared the winner, but for the record, George Carlin called W. ""Governor Bush"" because that was the last office he held that he was duly elected to. So in the highly unlikely even that what you wrote plays out, Trump would be the second unelected President ever."
You stop that right now.
Nah
False. This isn’t 2000 and the margin is not small enough for his court challenges to mean anything.
"Couple things:
The first unelected president in US history was Gerald Ford.

After everything that happened over the summer I doubt people just give up easy, things will definitely not go back to normal."
not gonna happen
Gerald Ford. Also depending on how solid Biden can make his claim I can see him spending his first few days as potus in a campaign bus outside the White House while they figure out the proper way to remove his ass. If he somehow stays things will not go back to normal
ok
Every part of this comment after the first sentence is wrong
"Not how it works, pal."
"> Trump will be the first unelected President in US History.

Gerald Ford?"
except it doesn’t work like that. i strongly doubt the courts will even take the case lol
Umm... no?
"> Trump will be the first unelected President in US History.

Second. Gerald Ford was picked as Nixon's new VP after Agnew resigned, then became president when Nixon resigned."
Gerald Ford was appointed VP and then assumed the Presidency when Nixon resigned.
"Nah, this would be the breaking point. If it was a ‘normal’ year and a ‘normal’ candidate, I’d probably agree. Everything is different now but either way, things have the potential to get really bad."
That is actually Gerald Ford!
"Thankfully it doesn’t work that way. A concession is a polite formality, not legally binding. If Biden wins, he wins. End of story."
"The probability of this is fortunately lower then that of Trump losing handidly. GA, PA, NV are all trending to deliver a larger EC victory to Biden than Trump won himself."
Don’t put that voodoo on us man
Courts have already told him to pound sand.
Are they actual official observers associated with an organization or just random crazies with a superiority complex?
Because ugly trump heads get crazy with guns
"They are lieing 

A lower courte ruled that random people can observe 

Higher court overturned that ruling 

Republicans are desperate"
Do not believe Republican Senators.
Didn't the USPS just set precedent that court orders are more like court suggestions?
"Fox news said the opposite, they let the poll watchers in, but with a six feet distance, and the gop watchers dont like that"
They probably believe that the observers aren't there to observe.
"You heard Pat Toomey spreading misinformation. Observers are being allowed, they're just throwing a fake temper tantrum because they have to stay 6 feet away from workers instead of breathing covid down their neck."
The observers have always been inside. They were asked to keep a distance. Trump sued to get closer. The court allowed them to be 6 feet away. They're claiming that's not close enough.
That wasn't confirmed and is from someone that was a guest. The anchor even called into question that it was worth following up but not confirmed by anyone.
the numbers are slowing down because mail-in ballots take longer to count
It takes a long time. We just need to be patient.
"I personally like the ""Conspiracy theory"" a few posted as to why states are really starting to take a long time.

...nobody wants to be the first to give the election to Biden, and have all the Trump Milita's drive into their state and start shooting the state up!

...and there's some president for that, given the armed douchebags who showed up to Arizona's counting house several times already! >\_<"
You act like people haven’t been calling this exact scenario.
"It's because mail in ballots are processed differently and they take more time.  Usually we don't notice it because there's so few the media will often call a race before it's certified, but with COVID there was a huge amount this year.

Also most states aren't normally this close so having 99% of the vote in the past didn't require us to keep waiting."
Normal
Less than what is current pace is.
67~
65ish
"I have been referring to this site. It's not an official PA site and number may be off cut they seem to be the same as I am seeing on other sites.

We won't until like the 12th or 13th

"Yes, a concession isn't a legally binding thing.  He won't though.  It's debatable that he will concede even if it gets called for Biden."
Absolutely no way in hell he concedes right now. But yes I think you can revoke it. If I remember my history classes correctly in 2000 Al Gore conceded and then revoked it
No way in hell he concedes. He’s an egomaniac and hates losing.
"Conceding doesn't really have a legal implication I think. Whether he concedes or not (he won't), he's out of office if he loses."
""" Proud boys, time to stand up"""
What does Beck Bennett think though?
And we trust him over everyone else including Fox because?
AZ doesn't matter either way anymore. Biden is going to take PA regardless
When was the last time the numbers were even updated? I keep seeing people mention AZ. Those numbers haven't moved for hours.
Biden will still win PA and NV. 279/259
Fox News and AP stand by their predictions it will remain blue
Its only 9k difference...dude were gonna win it
"By less than half a percent though. 
That's pretty wild."
"Shouldn't be a shock, it's a super red state."
"So I think the best case scenario would actually (and I hurt typing this) be for Biden to lose the presidency in Georgia and for both senate races to go to run offs. I think a narrow loss for Biden could galvanize Democrats to the polls for the senate race, especially if Stacey Abrams heavily campaigns. I would LOVE to see GA go blue, but I’m concerned the Democrats will get complacent."
"If we throw everything we have at it, we could take both seats.  Winning the White House and emphasizing that we MUST retake the senate might be enough to energize the voters.

There are a lot of hard right people who care about the Trump show only. They may have voted for all the downballot R's out of convenience or because they were told to by fox news, but they aren't going to come out just to support runoff candidates once Trump loses. Those people are just going to go back to being non-voters. 

So it will be a fight between dems and ""real"" Republicans, and I think we can win that fight, especially with everything that's at stake."
All effort on these races. Stacey Abrams to the rescue!
One Senate seat is completely worthless. Dems need two.
We need both. Only one is as bad as none.
49-51 is basically the same as 48-52 (I know an additional could be picked up in 2 years). The potential 50-50 is worth the risk
"Who cares ? You need both seats there is no difference between 49 and 48 for dems because McConnell has shown he keeps his side in line. We just saw Barrett that they are willing to lose for party if need be


Edit: Hell even if we won both seats and were at 50 we would still be at a disadvantage because Schumer doesn’t have his house in order and we will have breakaway votes often"
"Rs will show up regardless. 

We need both seats for a tie so it becomes absolutely vital for Georgia to show up. The DNC is going to throw an insane amount of money at this, I'm guessing a billion dollar special election."
At this point going for both is the only way to get anything meaningful. If we end up in the end at 49-51 or 48-52 we will still have Mitch being a stonewall to Biden's agenda. I believe Warnock really will attract votes from people who will then also vote for Ossoff if he in the special election too. Really depends on the ground game in attracting voters between now and January.
"What’s the use of having an extra seat if Dems don’t have a majority? What we gonna do, keep crossing our fingers that Collins will work with the Dems?"
"It's all or nothing with the two seats to get to a number in the Senate where you can pass legislation. Two years from now, historically speaking, the Dems will lose seats in both the Senate and the House. The President's party basically always loses seats in the midterms.

The only way that changes is if Dems completely buck historical trends. Maybe they do, but I would find it unlikely, particularly after watching the results of this election."
Republicans doing good there
"Honestly even as a democrat its nice to have a more diverse congress, but if we had a gay Brazilian democrat i would be even happier."

Biden is on pace to win GA by 7652
actually i saw currently he is doing better than what is needed to win.  IIRC he needs 56% and he is currently pulling in 60%+
I think Georgia is looking surpsingly good. He's down to a 0.2% differential which is insane. I was looking at him flipping PA a lot more than Georgia but now I think anything is possible
This is not true. He's averaging 69.9% and needs 60.9% the last vote dump went 75% to him. He's ahead of where he needs to be if trends hold.
Hasn’t he been going at higher than 60% so far?
Um. No he doesn't? He has to win at about 62% which he's been doing handily.
Looks completely grey. Toss up. No need to feel discouraged.
Lies.
He needs to win 61%.  He won 75% the last big number drop and is averaging 69.8%.
Not true at all. If we continue to see similar trump/Biden split as we’ve seen all day Biden has this in the bag. No idea where you’re getting your info from....
But so far he's outpacing the percentage he needs in the last few drops.
"Trump is winning Georgia, that much is clear, but it really is not possible for him to snag the election. Everything is just a formality at this point."
Really?  What were the last couple of vote dumps?  He only needs like 64% of the vote to (very narrowly) pass him.
"He needs 60.9% of remaining ballots to win, and has been winning 69.5% as of late. It’s going to be very close."
"If there are 40k votes left and he is 9k behind, a 62/38 split gives him 24.8k vs 15.2k, which is a 9.6k margin.  What were his last few splits?"
He’s still on track to get around 9% more than he needs to win.
"On what grounds? Every ballot has been coming in around 70%+, that gives him 33,000 to 17000. He would still be up by 7000."
"If Biden goes 60%, which is less than he had been today, he’ll wind up with 30K of those remaining votes to 20K for Trump, giving him a 1K lead."
"He is doing fine. This morning, he had 61000 votes left and was behind by 20K. He has made up 10K in 20000 votes. He can easily make up 10K and add a 10K margin on top in another 40K votes."
Then he wins
Recounts don’t move races by tens of thousands of votes.
Then he would win the election
Then Biden loses simple as that lmao
Civil War
Disappointment is what
what happens if an asteroid comes from inside the sun and hits earth?
A recount isn’t really a threat. The most that’s ever been off is 13k. Trump isn’t likely to win any of those states but Arizona possibly.
Move out of the country.
that won't happen
Just stop
"Why do people think recounts are like voting a for a second time? If a state gets recounted, maybe 0.01 to 0.02 percent of votes change. EITHER WAY. So in the end, it will make a difference of like 200 votes maybe. They are a waste of money, nothing else..."
Not worth worrying about
"most recounts only change the results by a couple hundred votes.

so, nothing."
Recounts don’t change a result that significantly. They might find 100-200 vows or so
"Extremely unlikely that a recount changes anything in any state but GA and maybe NV depending on just how tight the margins are. 

Recounts legitimately only changed like 400 votes last election."
"You ever seen a recount? Hundreds of votes at most change. Won't hit even 1,000 votes difference."
What
I have been through about a dozen presidential elections. I cannot think of a recount in my lifetime that changed an outcome. Recounts usually swing totals about 100-200 votes max.
"Be shocked at a recount changing any more than a couple hundred votes. But if it's legit, it'll be accepted.

Won't happen. He won't even do most of the recounts because he'd have to pay for them first and he's broke."
No he doesn’t.
Are you not watching the trending?
The race will tighten as more of the mail-in ballots are counted. Still looks good for Biden.
Are you not watching the trend? 24 hours ago Trump had a lead of 192k. Now its 78k.
Nah Arizona and Nevada then it's a wrap
"Lol he only needs Nevada at this point. If Trump loses Georgia or Pennsylvania, it's over."
Trending pretty well though.
"Margin closing significantly with profound amount of ballots still left to be counted for from mostly Dem counties, so fortunately it is very likely Biden gets it."
"No, he doesn't. NV and AZ are enough to get 270"
"Yeah, we're a trash TV nation. Sorry to admit."
There's nothing else to talk about
Were celebrating a historic election
Democrats living rent-free in your head
Love it when Trump voters put an insult comic in the White House and now have a severe case of the butt hurt.
No way in hell am I getting anywhere near that cesspool
"Lol your brain is telling you to avoid it for a reason, let the cesspool of the internet percolate alone dude, your sanity will thank you for it"
"> once in a while there's something there that's good.

uh, disagree."
"yes, theyre pretty much just entertained, people cranking out memes faster than the last person"
"Yeah, they're in meltdown/conspiracy theories and they're getting trolled hard by Biden supporters and their Biden Presidential threads"
nah that shit hole will spread it's garbage anyways. why go look for it
"Last time I went it was all Hunter Biden penis, all the time."
I popped in this morning and it's filled with hilarious meltdowns
/pol/ is on suicide watch
Oh god no! That seems like torture.
"They're having a melt down, and it's ambrosia to my soul."
yes
Don't need to.
prolly tastes like mcdongles so mayb
"Considering Trump's diet of fast food and garbage, it wouldn't be eating one, it'd be drinking it."
I'll take my chances honestly
"He's going to lose anyway, why would anyone do that?"
That won't be necessary.
No. I can just wait about another 2 hours or so and watch him lose via Pennsylvania.
I'm just gonna wait for the vote results to come in thanks.
"No, I'd vote again and he would lose again because people don't fucking like him."
"Given that PA is basically a definite now, which means Trump loses, I’m gonna go with nahhh"
Pinal is red. Biden didn’t lose much
"I was surprised there was 40k outstanding in Pinal. That said a lot about how the post Nov 2 counts could break in Maricopa. It's basically the inverse of what happened in the blue wall and if you are an AZ voter you know barely anyone goes to the polls because 80% automatically get our ballot in the mail each election . Those trump voters used their mail ballots but didn't trust the mail in like Trump said not to and hand delivered them on election day in larger numbers. Those are the outstanding votes, the post Nov 2 absentee ballots."

It’s really not going to matter in the end I think.

Probably at least one & that person should lose their right to vote!!
Not enough :(
Biden.
Bill Clinton
Who's next?
Still Putin...
Yeezy
90k of the 330 + 90k lead.  he included the lead
Who isn't?
The 90k gap was included in that 188 iirc
"Here's the math (assumption was Biden receives 70% of remaining votes):

At the time, Trump led by 90542 votes. In addition to that lead, he would receive approximately 326338*0.3=97901 votes. So the total ""gap"" Biden would have to bridge is 90542+97901=188443.

Biden would receive 326338*0.7=228436.

So net result is a Biden win by 228436-188443=39993."
There were in Pennsylvania as well and Biden just flipped it.
"Not necessarily. Biden has been wining mail-in votes by a significant margin even in red counties. Democrats vote by mail even if they live in a red county.

Biden just got 69% of a batch of mail-in votes in a red county in Pennsylvania."
"What we've actually seen in Georgia is Biden winning the mail-in vote in RED counties. Not every red country, but many of them."
"It's not like the current governor cheated like a motherfucker while being in charge of the state's voting to win.  And it's not like he's a weak-ass sycophant who can't wait to get his tongue in Trump's drawers.  They'll ""find"" some votes, sure.   Enough?"
"We'll find out. Military does tend to be Republican, but are they leaning Trump lately? Don't know."
[deleted]
Expats are included in that and they lean Biden
I dunno...that military poll from a couple months ago was the worst I've ever seen for a Republican president.
"Appears to have been debunked 

https://www.8newsnow.com/i-team/i-team-im-not-going-to-have-this-taken-away-from-me-blind-woman-from-nevada-told-she-already-voted/amp/?__twitter_impression=true"
It’s tweeted out by team trump and is a clip of Fox News... what makes you think it’s true?
She tried to vote twice
NV officials have debunked this.
Trump getting desperate
"No, it almost certainly isn't true."
You're being ridiculous
Election officials looked into it and she actually tried to vote twice by sending in two ballots with identical signatures.
"From a talking head on fox, I guess they found her ballot and called her on her bullshit, there's no comment now."
"She voted twice, which is illegal, just like her president told her too."
"bitter old hag making up bullshit to salvage her shattered world. 

probably getting paid to say it, too, but could be doing it out of love for trump, who knows?"
Just some crazy old lady who probably forgot she sent in her ballot showed up they told her that she can put in a new vote right them and there and she declined it
"Lol like a week after this they came out and said they found her ballot with her signature on it, and when they reached out for her to comment, she declined."
"The registrar was asked about this earlier today and went into detail about how they investigated it.

Here is the clip: https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4920976/user-clip-jill-stokke-ballot"
Is it possible someone stole her mail? Sure. Is it possible she's lying? Sure. Is it possible something else happened and that's why she didn't get her ballot? Sure.
"Over the past four years, have you found that Trump diehards usually tell the truth?"
"What's unclear is if she tried to get another ballot and therefore, voted.

How was it stolen? Someone take it out of her mail box? Break in and take it? Never got to her? No clarity whatsoever"
"an old lady says her ballot was ""taken"" lol well then it must be true"
"She must live in a largely blue county so her ballot was ""collateral damage"" when it accidentally got lost by the USPS."
"Generally curious, why are you going into a livethread to try to gain a beginner's understanding of the political divide in the US?"
Facebook? Really. And it’s not by default. Those that are on Reddit are more likely to be politically informed. If you are at all a little informed and have a sane head on your shoulders you quickly see how bad republicans are.
"Because they support a muslim hating, concentration camp making, embezzling, ridiculously corrupt liar that kept lying about us being a crazed mob. We've been trying to show them the truth for 4 years. But they would rather accept a con that calls them beautiful and smart than face hard realities. Eventually you stop trying to help them and all that's left is resentment."
Policy
"I don't ""hate"" Republicans and it's not ""by default."" I've observed the conservative platform all my life and found it to uphold the opposite of what I believe in. Donald Trump is the crystallization of the conservative rhetoric, and his enablers befuddle and frustrate me."
"See, the past 4 years as they supported their party getting hijacked by a cult"
"I wouldn't say the majority do by default. But a lot of republican politicians tend to support legislation that primarily benefits white wealthy people, usually straight men, to a much greater degree than the democrats. Especially social policy."
"Younger generation, more free thinking. Capable of using technology better I guess. It’s pretty easy to find republicans online, they just end up being kept away in little clans because otherwise they are violent and shitty to others if in groups. Two differing opinions use to be fine until Trump made them literal foaming at the mouth sheep."
People online tend to be younger.
Because it saves time.
"It isn’t by default. It is simply that Republicans have been sophists who, under their weepy and outraged,  disjointed and disingenuous arguments of pretend and conflicting
principles, are a destructive group of authoritarians; they are greedy and cruel little despots and the villains of our age. They have modeled themselves after the robber barons and Torquemada figures.  This vile party of bullies desire to become PolPot and would  let a virus or a famine kill their constituents (or subjects in their eyes) because we don’t matter. 

They are willing to strip and destroy the planet and declare the act to be god’s will."
"1,333	Trump 30.7% / 69.3% Biden

was only 1300 votes"
"Yeah, was from a republican county."
"if this is the last update, then its fine.

2020-11-05 22:45  ***  Trump leading by 90,027 votes   Remaining (est.): 430,390    Change:   1,333 (Trump 30.7% / 69.3% Biden)   Precincts: 8196/9128  Biden needs 60.46% [-0.027%]  Biden recent trend 72.54%


he still trending 72% out of 60% he needs, its been like that for a while, 80's 70's and high 60's."
There are a lot of absentee votes coming from rural PA and those are only slightly in Biden's favor if at all
"500 votes, tiny drop from a small county."
"Last update from a few minutes ago was a 69% Biden update with an additional 1,333 votes against the gap, the only times he's been under the pace needed was when the update was in the double digits of votes."
Thank you for your baseless and alarmist input
For Biden to take Pennsylvania?
"Not just Philly, though. Keep the faith."
"Another 25,000 approximately in Delaware County too. I think he'll make it today. If not they will be counting those 35k Allegheny votes tomorrow."
relax.
Hopefully PA flips before that happens. That’s what it’s looking like rn. AZ is giving me heart palpitations
What about Mark Kelly?
Trump won't win a court battle in Penn
Stop sniffing glue.
Not at all
"Not a chance, they have no legal standing to toss out votes."
The civil unrest will be astronomical.
this was a good fanfiction
"Stop fearmongering, asshat"
And a civil war begins... don't see it happening somehow.
"Its looking like the number of votes they could throw out is like sub 350 total, I dont think when Biden flips it will it be that close."
biden should not concede.
"Everything checks out beside the third paragraph. Trump will declare victory in Trump fashion, Biden will concede and act like he's confused. Crowds will burn down the White House and a civil war will be in our hands."
"Thanks I hate

Luckily that won't happen"
"I don't think you can just void votes... Like from the voters perspective, they were following what at the time was a legal method to get their voices heard in the election and that matters. Sooo, even if you hypothetically throw those votes out, you'd have to give those voters who lost their voice recourse to be able to vote again, because they previously were led to believe they did so legally. I imagine that would quickly work it's way through the courts."
"Lmao nice try, that’s not how it’s been working for him so far."
Stop drinking
Gross dooming
"This works if Biden wins, but telling donny you politely disagree would not end with much civility :/"
That’s a no
/r/TIHI
No way it happens in that fashion.
You're not supposed to drink the bong water
">Trump and his lawyers will win litigation on ballots in Pennsylvania, and a judge will order those votes void. Which puts trump back into the lead. Arizona flips. Georgia holds.

hot take"
"I think, I want to know where to get some of  what you're smoking! Like, damn bro, did you get Mandela effected? You know we're in the darkest timeline, I'd get out of here if I could."
There just isn't enough info yet.
No.
Nope.
Yes
I doubt it but not impossible
No
The trend leads to probably not. Trump needs 57% of the ballots left and his average trend has been 59%. Nobody knows for sure though. All we can do is wait and hope for PA/GA.
"Ignore that, that's just the insane ramblings of Trump and his supporters. Trump is the one trying to steal the election, not Biden."
No
None whatsoever
There's a ton of evidence actually. All you have to do is PayPal me your life savings and I'll show it to you
Nil
No
"None what so ever. Even international observers say no.

"Yeah, it's on Hunter Biden's laptop with the obamagate at ping pong pizza."
Literally none
"No matter what the results were this election, Trump was going to claim the Democrats were trying to steal it"
Trump's word.  So no there isn't any evidence.  He has already had two of his three court challenges thrown out because of lack of evidence.
Only fake screenshots as far as I’ve seen so far..
100% of the evidence points to Republicans doing it.
Not even a speck
"If by ""steal"" you mean ""win fair and square"" then yes. Otherwise no. All that is happening right now is that ballots are being counted which differs from state to state due to not having a unified policy for tallying ballots. The only people out there screaming about the ballot count being unfair also happen to be people flying Trump flags and wearing MAGA hats."
"Its in the box that Kenj-san is bringing down right now. 

What's in the box?

NOTHING."
Most likely not.
"There is a bit of disagreement. AP (gold standard usually) called it really early, along with FOX news. But there is criticism they called it too early. I think Biden will definitely win but shit happens."
"I assume their models on voting showed that Trump needed a certain turnout from specific areas and to carry a specific percentage and that if he didn't hit them then he'd lose. The Fox News guy is legit, so this seems likely."
"Based on the number of votes left, it is VERY hard for trump to pull flip in AZ."
Final county is hard blue
"AP and Fox were using a newer, different modeling and prediction tool that did not take exit polling into account.    The other networks were using traditional exit polling based models.

Looks like the new tool might have some kinks to work out .. Or maybe it will be spot on.  Looks a lot closer than you would think given how early they called it."
That was fox news; they have a reputation for accurately calling races long before other news orgs.
no!9
No.
Nope.
Nope
"No, lol."
"No, he's winning this thing."
I’d say quite the opposite
yeah pretty much
pretty much.
Yes
"Biden is gonna flip Pennsylvania. Under 100k with over 300k votes left to count. 

I think he’ll end up getting all the leftover states except maybe Georgia and NC. If he wins Georgia it’ll be by less than 5k."
Quite the opposite.
Says who?
How so?
And your source is?
Based on what?
based on what
"9,000 gap with 37,000 left to be counted

Yeah this ain’t out of reach friend."
where are you seeing that?
How so?
Based on what?
"Not seeing any updates from AP. 

[https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html)"
Source? That wasn’t the case shortly ago.
That's too bad.
This is not the case.
Why do people keep saying this? This isn't true. Not with how many votes we think are left and the rate they're breaking for biden.
According to who
Not according to the data I am looking at.  He needs 61 percent of the remaining 43k votes.
What's this based on?
You're wrong
What makes you say it's out of reach? I'm not finding any information that says Georgia is lost.
For the second or third time?
"Hey, you should uninstall Internet Explorer"
Crock of shit. Both sides have always had people there.
"They were supposed to allow them closer, and the PA Supreme Court I think knocked that down quickly too."
They were permitted to be 20 ft away from the counters. The ruling changed that to 6 ft.
"They had observers, I believe they had to maintain 20' distance for covid reasons. The judge ruled it could be 6' so they could see better. It was a bs lawsuit."
"It's completely false. There are observers from both parties inside standing 6 feet away from where the vote-counting is happening.  Not to mention the ballot counting is being live streamed.

[https://www.wgal.com/article/pa-commonwealth-court-allows-trump-campaign-observers-to-get-closer-to-philadelphia-ballot-counting/34589143#](https://www.wgal.com/article/pa-commonwealth-court-allows-trump-campaign-observers-to-get-closer-to-philadelphia-ballot-counting/34589143#)"
"It’s a crock, they have observers.  Fox was just showing a picture from a GOP observer taken inside the room."
"Take this with a grain of salt, but for what's worth I did come across some tweets earlier this morning of people complaining that observers weren't allowed, to which someone replied they already were but only at 50 feet, and then someone countered saying they were supposed to be allowed six feet away or something.

Sounds like a dispute over allowed observation distance is being spun into ""being turned away""."
Republican observers were crying foul that pollwatchers standing 20 feet away from the vote counting was too much. The court that reviewed the suit suggested that 6 feet be acceptable.
"It's BS. Every vote counting center has many many observers from each party in place for the duration of the count (they all have the same number rof observers). So when Karen the vote observer from another area comes in and demands to observe the count, they legally cannot allow her as they already have equal representation for all the parties."
"There’s are people from both parties that register and get sworn in to count votes. Every ballot has one rep and one dem counting the exact same ballot together. 

There also observers from both parties in the room. 

There are also live streams in places like Philly that the public can watch. 

PA is doing everything correctly."
"All parties involved have observers ready to go and present before the counting even started on the 3rd. The people not being let in were randos on twitter on the street many of whom had guns. Due to tight privacy and security laws they cannot allow anyone not specifically authorized to do so see the ballots. Nobody but you and a member of the election authority is supposed to see your ballot, can you imagine if they let randos in off the street because they were yelling about election fraud and then they started taking names of people that voted the ""wrong"" way or something? The whole process is strict for a reason."
PA Courts already told them to pound sand they had no evidence or basis for their lawsuit
"""Debacle"" you mean slow? Lol shit is fine."
No only because of Republicans. They don't let them pre count votes. Makes it take longer
"How is it a ""debacle?"" They are legit, and they are being counted. Whats your problem?"
"I mean, GOP went out of their way to make it a debacle. Check us out here in WA. 100% vote by mail and we were done in no time at all. No rona worries either"
"It's almost like he knew in advance mail in votes would be counted last in some cases, that there would be delays because of that, and dumbasses like you wouldn't be able to properly reason about the situation."
Cope.
Wouldn't have been ridiculous if Trump and the GOP hadn't forced them to wait to count mail in ballots until after in person ballots
"Shoo fly, your moment in the sun is over :("
I’m so sorry your impatience can’t handle the situation. We’ve been warned up and down about this and suddenly everybody’s pretending it’s so weird.
Imagine that. You undermine a thing and the thing has issues. Huh funny how that works
It's only a debacle because of all the obstruction he and his party are throwing out
Thanks YOLO420_dropthebass
This shit is democracy.
"We knew it would be, but the state houses of PA refused to make any changes to alleviate it."
"Yeah, after it was purposefully hindered by GOP state legislatures."
cope
Yeah but a debacle only because republicans specifically made it so🤷‍♀️
"> a giant debacle

Only for trump and his supporters. This is how democracy work. Get with it."
It’s not a debacle it takes longer
"GOP wouldn't let them count them before election day in PA, btw."
Lol cope
because republicans made it a debacle. they should have been counting these weeks ago.
The GOP blocked early ballot counting in PA (and likely elsewhere) and in general tried to hamper mail in voting.  This is on them.
Only because of bullshit laws that don't let them count ahead of time. Florida had their shit done instantly.
"If his supporters had used mail-in voting we wouldn't have these 90%+ results for Biden which make projections impossible, and the whole thing could have been called on Tuesday night. Trump did this on purpose."
Yes. He made sure they were.
It's a debacle because the republicans denied them from starting the count early.
"Candidates don't choose the winner, the voters do. Just because Trump and his supporters don't like the results, doesn't mean that they are in any way inaccurate."
"To be fair:

* The Senate declined to give states money to help with mail-in
* It is hard to have a lot of people in one place to count because COVID (in fact, I'm guessing some states are violating their own COVID restrictions to count lol)
* State Legs are to blame for not letting states count before day of. TX and OH counted mail-ins early and we had results very quickly after poll close.

In sum, mail-in was a debacle because Republicans made it that way."
Because PA Republicans delayed the count
It’s only a debacle because republicans insisted on not letting states count them until election day
"Mail in voting works fine in California, Oregon, etc.  It's the rules republicans set up that make it a clusterfuck.  Remember that the goal of Republicans is to make Government as dysfunctional as possible."
You mean a more socially responsible way of voting during a pandemic.
How dare people vote
"Given the record high turn out I’d call this election a resounding success for democracy. There were pushes to allow votes to be counted as they were received and Republicans did everything they could to shut them down. So, short of willfull Republican fuckery, this election has gone wonderfully."
It’s only a debacle because they did not start counting ahead of time. These are manual ballots they have to count.
It still is
"On the contrary, it’s looking very good"
"He’s tracking to finish 40,000 votes ahead of Trump if he stays on course"
No. Right on track to go for Biden probably soon.
"He's 90k behind with >300k votes to count, so probably in good shape."
Not as good as we thought but still really good
It's still looking good as far as I know. Trump's lead just shrunk under 100k
Why
AZ should be in the bag. The difference is about 70k.
It over - it’s all good
Lmao go away
I don’t
"If you're for Trump, I'd agree"
Why??? Why is there so much doomsday scenarios in this thread?
No
A piece of candy corn and silver definitely equals gold.
No
Which was expected. So no big deal.
It’s been a foregone conclusion for 9 hrs
Was anybody realistically expecting otherwise?
"Yeah, NC has not really been expected to go to Biden.

Hell win the rest in play tho. Georgia will be very close and need a recount."
republicans also believe that voting is unconstitutional now.
"They were allowed to watch from x feet.  Sued to be able to watch from y feet and it was upheld.  Polls rearranged tables to accommodate them and got back to work but appealed as the new arrangement slowed them down.

FRAUD!!! OBSERVERS DENIED ACCESS!!!!  WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG!!!!"
"I really want one day a judge to simply throw out their case saying ""Your party lives in a world of fiction, making up false allegations without any evidence on a daily basis. Therefore your claim is rejected as having no basis in fact without further consideration""."
"no. he is about to lose it, actually."
Where'd you see that? He's 3600k up with 98% reporting
Because they potentially called one state wrong?
based on?
Lol whether or not he concedes is irrelevant. I'd love to see him get tossed out on inauguration day
"Good thing he doesn't have to concede. Once it hits 270, that's it. Even if he refuses to concede or refuses to give a speech, he's still out. He probably doesn't know this himself, and it'll come as quite a shock to him when he finds out."
"He may not concede, but if he loses he is out of there lmao."
right that name is cringe af nephew
"While true, I agree he won’t leave the White House, the presidency isn’t a person and the federal government doesn’t elect them. He will just be a guy. The office will leave him."
"Then what happens? He just... stays there, you think?"
Well when he loses he won’t have a choice come January 21
On January 21st it doesn't matter whether he concedes or not.
"To be honest, his compliance isn’t a [factor](https://youtu.be/Epe75JrJr4g)"
"You realize that they had to shut down the counting sight early in Phoenix yesterday, right? And that ~95% of protests haven't included violence, looting, or fires?"
"Based on what, precisely?  Take your BS elsewhere."
It might if the rest of the votes are like the recent dumps.
Damn
I think GA is gonna flip.
"GA will go to Biden. 

AZ is clearly Biden. 

PA will go to Biden. 

NV will go to Biden. 

Trump has no chances of winning. His lawsuits will be dismissed."
Based on what lol
"Lolz, AZ only has mail in ballots left"
Nope.
No.
Ha that’s baseless.
I've never seen anything so wrong.
GA has gone blue? When?
Why will AZ go Trump?
Nate Cohn dropping some hints that GA might be on the way to Biden
"<10,000 votes to go in GA, I wouldn’t count it as a loss just yet"
AZ will not go to Trump. Fox and AP still stand firm. I trust them. I doubt Trump can overperform with the rest of the absentee ballots
GA margin is down to 9k. AZ we don't know shit until we hear something at 9EST tonight. PA is going towards Biden.
Nah
I wouldn't feel comfortable calling it either way for GA right now. It's just too close.
AP stands by the call. Stop dooming.
They haven't been updating
bots looking like bots.
Why
Arizona has been won by President Joseph R. Biden!  Move on!
They haven't reported any new numbers and won't for another 3 hours
Username checks out
Where are you seeing that?
"I know, I feel like my hands are tied after being happy to see us go blue too."
Biden already won it. Now untwist your panties
What's with you doomers who are obsessed with AZ? God damn.
Been watching this too. Thankfully PA and GA comin in hotter and hotter by the ballot
Why?
Dooming bs
Begone dumbass
It hasn’t changed in hours. What do you mean?
Explain why
No one. It also doesn’t happen.
Name one dead guy you know that voted
"Lol is this the narrative? Democrats are just letting dead people vote?

Lol ridiculous"
prove it
all lives matter
If they voted last week and died a couple days ago? Yes. If they passed away a year ago and somehow got a ballot? No.
"Citation, please?"
How can anyone justify a fake bot spreading misinformation?
"Nobody justifies it, but it's also something that doesn't happen."
Proof?
You can’t really. But that’s not happened.
I've yet to meet a person who has
have proof of that?
"you can't. that kind of fraud isn't new in this election, though, and i think it takes smarter people than me to figure out why it happens"
Can you show this happening in more than isolated incidents?
Prove where it happened...
Where is there evidence of that happening in any remotely meaningful quantity?
I haven't seen anyone justifying that.
Chris Farley can.
"No one can.  
  
Guess it's a good thing that it's not happening :)"
"If they sent off a mail in ballot, then dropped dead of covid, why shouldn’t that ballot count?"
"I think the argument would go ""What if someone casts a vote when alive and dies before the election"" or something like that.  It's a real possibility with COVID"
"Real answer:
Dead people aren't voting. Troll elsewhere."
Can you provide evidence of this?
"right now it looks more like a simple mistake rather than this widespread conspiracy to steal the election. i worked the polls 2 days ago and checked in hundreds of voters, and sometimes someone’s father would pop up when i entered their info and i would have to verify DOB to avoid making a mistake. if someone wasn’t paying attention maybe they checked in a dead relative with a similar name.  

that would be a more logical conclusion than there being this national lowkey plan to win the election via dead ppls votes"
"If I have a heart attack and die at 10pm on the 3rd after having voted, does that mean my vote shouldn't count?"
This was a tired line in the fucking seventies
"There aren't any dead people voting. That's just the fallback or go-to used by the GOP. Been that way for many years now.

No idea how they justify it, but then again, facts and reality seem foreign to a lot of the GOP sometimes."
"Fraud, but the question is how many and how often are they caught. A perfect election is the ideal, but in reality a fair election is what we want."
"If it’s true, can you prove it wasn’t done as a ploy to make it look like there is wide spread fraud?"
"Because it’s a right wing bogeyman that happens so so so rarely that even if every instance from the last 100 years was added up and placed in the least populated state, it would not shift the vote. It’s a non-issue."
Typical supporter.  Real honest question means that is exactly the opposite of that.  You guys must have been great at the opposite game when you were kids.   Or would it be bad at the opposite game?
"Well, if someone votes, and then on their way home from the polling station they get hit by a car, I wouldn't be mad if their vote counted.  I don't really see a difference with a vote that was mailed in and the person dies between the time they mailed their vote in and election day."
"Uneducated answer : I feel like if the person casts a  legit vote, and then dies before election night, it should count. No one else made that vote for them.  It doesn’t feel like fraud, just unfortunate that the person didn’t get to see their votes impact."
"There is no justification. But you do need proof that they were dead at the time the ballot was cast. Has there been evidence that this happened? Name, county, state, copy of ballot, death certificate, etc?"
"Were they alive and eligible to vote on election day? If so, it counts."
"Unless they cast their vote before they died, I don't think anyone is."
"2 Trump voters in different states tried to vote for their dead mothers. 

Also, ND elected a congressman who died from Covid a month ago"
"Show me that

1. It happened 

2. It happened at any amount that MATTERS

Then we can talk. Because right now it's just a bs talking point meant to distract and sow divison"
Why are you defending a dead man walking?
"If a person is alive to vote early or cast an absentee ballot, but then dies before 'election day', I don't see an issue with counting their vote. There was no intent of fraud and the vote was cast legally. The overall number of those people will be relatively low, and effectively policing it (e.g., confirming every voter is still alive on election day) would be a massive undertaking that could lead to legitimate votes being thrown out based on faulty data. Its not worth it. 

Someone stealing a dead person's identity to cast a vote in their name is a problem and is illegal."
"The GOP-led legislature in PA agreed before the election to observe from 6 ft due to social distancing. Now they want to be closer than that. 

They were the majority and they agreed to the rules. They can't just arbitrarily change their minds because this orange piece of shit doesn't like the result."
"PA. Philly. Earlier reporting from FOX, CNN, MSNBC is that the Republican reviewers selected were allowed in and the barrier was set within 6ft of counting tables.

If you can't watch the process within six feet you need either Glasses or are indeed blind."
Because it's not true.
For every Republican allowed access to watch there is an equal number of Democrat and Independent.  They challenge votes they don't think are credible.  So yeah.. they get close enough to do that.
dude your concern trolling is both annoying as fuck and plainly obvious
What the actual fuck are you looking at?
That's not true
"Are you drunk, there are more than enough PA votes lol

Oh nevermind, I see you're a Trump supporter."
Not true on PA
enough votes in both.
No.
What are you talking about? Biden is almost certainly gonna get PA
The fuck are you talking about?
are u smoking weed bro
Are you legally high? Plenty of time for both PA and GA to flippity floppity floop.
Yes there is
"“I havent been able to watch, so instead of some quick skimming to see what is going on, i need someone to summarize everything for me”"
"AZ is close but favoring Biden. NV could be called for Biden according to Nate Silver. Biden is outdoing the margins he needs in mail ins in PA. Same in GA, but the margin for error is a bit smaller."
"No shit it adds to 100, those are the percentages of votes counted so far"
There are still around 40k left.
No we’re still waiting on ballots to be counted.
o.o
You're wrong
"Those percentages are a percent of votes counted, not of the total votes cast!"
Those are percentages of the currently counted votes. They're always supposed to add to 100%
"No, there's like 30k votes left to count.


No matter how many votes are counted, those percentages will always add up to 100%.  Biden could have 10 and Trump could have 10 and it would still say 50%/50%. It's out of votes counted, not votes cast."
Of the currently counted votes... the percentages change over time as more votes come in.
"I mean, they should always add up to 100%. That's the proportions of the count, not of the total votes"
You joking? They're doing percentage of counted ballots. Has nothing to do with what has yet to be counted
That's percentage of recorded votes cast not expected vote totals
Of the current vote tally.
There are outstanding ballots. The percentages add up to 100 because that's how the current votes are distributed.
Lol those are the percentages but still votes to count....
"That's not how that works lol

That's % of current votes. There's still about 40k+ votes left to be reported."
This has to be the worst take I’ve seen on the election thus far
That's not how you make people safer
"Nope.  Let them break, and be handled.  Trump goes down."
Way to have a backbone...
This is a really dumb perspective.
Delete this.  Terrible take.
"""I kinda hope the terrorists get their way because I am afraid of defending my democracy."""
If they don't like it they can leave.
And not the safety of America the next 4 years?
You should be worried about people's safety if he wins more then.
Fuck that you should not be threatened to submission
Fuck that
No you're not
Appeasement is rarely a long term strategy.
That's coward talk.
Fuck 'em! Don't let the terrorists win
Fuck that. That’s giving up.
Stop fearmongering.
All the more reason he should lose. Those people shouldn't be emboldened.
We are screwed either way right now. It’s either violence or an incompetent administration during a pandemic. People are dying regardless. I’m so stressed out.
"The vast majority of them are scared as fuck to even enter a city, even with a gun.

Why are you scared of them?"
Fuck that. His supporters are quickly becoming more terrorist than “patriot” and should be treated as such.
Screw that noise. That is exactly the type of fear and defeatism that they've been trying to brainwash Americans with.
You don’t want him to win at this point. Trust me.
Pfft how about no
"Can't give in to bullies. They won't do anything. There will be riots on a small scale, but they're not going to go Mad Max or anything lol."
We sold our souls fo safety in the aftermath of 9/11 and it solves nothing but to invade our privacy and invade other countries. You do NOT EVER give the republican reactionaries what they want. They will threaten violence but they sheepishly back away when the chips are down. They WILL obey the law because they want a daddy to tell them what to do.
"People are going to die one way or the other. 

They made winning such an important part of their world that they can’t handle the loss."
"No don’t put that out there. 

I am scared for people tho"
They handled his win terribly last time.
No
dude literally no one knows. Take a Valium and a mental break
"No. The lead has narrowed, but it's still 67k+ over and doesn't look like it's going to drop that drastically. Time will tell though."
Why would it be going to him? Biden’s been holding a good lead there for a while.
"Joe Biden is a ahead by 70000 votes, so no"
No.
No
No and it never was
Probably not.
That would be implying america hasn’t been great under trump the past four years what makes you think he will change it
Yo what's q saying about all this?
Hi QANON hope you are very unhappy today!
"Didn't Trump, like, make friends with Castro and he's going to escape through some secret tunnel or some shit?"
I'm sorry.
why
"Trump is so 2016.

Time for something new. BIDEN 2020"
Probably not
Lol bad night ahead for you. Get some beer.
1 term  impeached president
Wtf is WWG1WGA
Do you have kik? 😂 your account is a joke.
They are following usual protocols. Absolutely nothing out of the ordinary is going on.
No it is not true. Poll watchers for both parties are there
"No there's no fraud, don't fall for Trump's bullshit"
Lol totally untrue. There are republicans and democrats at every counting center
No it is not.
Still conservative idiots
You sure owned us Libs
2015 wants its memes back
"people whose party will win the presidency, and republicans"
This is how panic mode looks like
Wrong
Keep drinking that Crowder koolaid buddo
Sex and gender are not the same thing. You are using the word gender wrong.
Lmaoo I love this. Trump supports are becoming so erratic due to the loss that they are just spewing out random things. It's like a talking doll when its battery is low.
What’s your point?
Good one !!
/s you forgot this
I think you got lost.
90% of remaining votes are from heavily blue Clark County.
no
Not likely.
"Uh, no."
Wtf !!
Massively unlikely. Clark county is where almost everyone lives and will most likely be blue.
"God no, Biden is in the lead and 90% of the remaining votes to be counted are from the bluest area of the state"
"Biden will win Nevada handily. Now he just has to win AZ, PA, or GA, and it’s game over. Hell, he might even win all 3."
No.
"What makes you think that? Biden still has a large lead,"
"> JUST IN: Nevada's Secretary of State says there are approximately 190,150 ballots left to count, 90% of which are from heavily-Democratic Clark County. h/t 
@StevenTDennis

https://twitter.com/EmmaKinery/status/1324463595615330304

Explain to the rest of us how you see the majority of Clark County ballots going to Trump - and in a big enough margin to actually overcome his current deficit too. 

Fucking LOL."
It’s difficult to be affected by something that doesn’t exist.
Try harder.
Surprised trump is even this close given all the Donald Trump corruption.
"Well, that’s because hunter isn’t running...moron."
Corruption doesn't matter anymore after four years of Trump. Compared to him anything else is corruption-lite.
"Surprised Trump got as many voted as he did, given all the corruption"
Which corruption is that? The one supposedly detailed in a 60+ page document that was written by someone who doesn't exist?
No.
I would bet you good money Biden wins Arizona Nevada Georgia and Pennsylvania
"The math implies that Biden wins the remaining states. (NV, GA, PA, AZ)

Granted the trend could change."
">	GA and AZ are both going to AZ. 

You hear that guys? AZ is getting a whole state to absorb!"
What do you mean? Maricopa and Pima are the last counties for AZ and they are both bluer than my balls.
Proofread
Source?
"Curious where you're getting your news - what I find is AZ currently favors Biden, and has even been called for Biden by many outlets.  Do you mean NV?"
Just dipped to 78k lol
Lol. No it's down to 78k but sure
Just went down to 78k...
Down to 78k
78k buddy
78k now
"Nice cope my dude, lmao"
Lol you have to either be delusional or just not understand math to think this
It's 78k now
Down to 78k now
Nope its 78k now.
Lmfaoooo!
Stop the misinformation!
Down to 78k.
"Just went to 78,000"
78k now
"In fact, its down to 78k now lmao. You suck"
Data is not your friend.
78 now
Eh...
Trump is old as fuck too your argument makes zero sense
Byeee
2 iq
Trump is literally 3 years younger than him. Fuck off with that shit
Trump is 74 so hes not really young himself
You really think Trump won't run again in 2024 at age 78 if he loses today?
"Yeah if he literally achieves nothing at all, he’s done a better job than Trump. So there’s that"
Ending Facism is achieved.
Trumps nearly the same age and obese? At least Biden is healthy. Although presidents should be younger IMO.
We got a live one boys!
Trump is 74?
"If you look at the other option, it’s not like they had a choice"
Dude Trump is like 3 years younger and more obese.
"really dude so is Trump, Trump just wears a ton of make up to hide it, if you stripped him down to the surface he probably makes TWD zombies look good. Trump is 74 they are both dinosaurs the difference with Joe he isn't a traitor and won't mooch tax dollars or put his kids in the white house"
And trump is 74 big fucking difference.
I would vote for an actual corpse over Trump.
Trump is 74
Not letting Trump pack the Supreme Court even further was a priority for me.
Someone to calm america the fuck down.
"Trump is fucking 74, what point are you trying to make?"
If he achieves nothing other than dying in office I will consider his presidency preferable to four more years of Trump.
"If the only thing he achieves is ""not being a Nazi,"" then he's already the clear cut better President."
He’s got nothing left to lose so he’ll do big things
lmao Trump is 74 and obese as fuck. What's your point here? I'll put money on Joe outliving Trump any day.
Do you think Trump looks any healthier? Genuine question.
He's literally only 3 years older than Trump. I don't think anyone's voting with age in mind.
He was jogging to the stage couple days ago. Trump can't handle walking down a ramp. Facts.
"He does look like he's gonna pass Trump in Georgia, good observation. Can't wait."
What’s the alternative? Setting aside all politics. trump is a dinosaur as well
"Just not being an incompetent racist moron would be a massive step up so the decision was pretty easy.

A rancid egg salad sandwich would make a better President than Trump."
"why even bother being this obtuse? for the majority of american citizens, biden in the white house is better than trump in the white house, full stop."
Have you witnessed the last 4 years? We are going back to normal rather than normalizing fascism. That’s why people support Joe.
Our alternative is Trump. What choice do we have?
Trump is 3 years younger than him...
Orange fan sad! Your homeboy Trump just lost to a fucking corpse.
A corpse is better than Trump
Trump is 76 so......
We expect him to actually give a shit about the thousands of people that are dying every day rather than sacrificing them to the economy gods
"honestly I think the right frames democrats/the left and their policies as far more scary and detrimental than they are. most people want affordable healthcare/universal healthcare to make our country stronger and people safer, we want people to not be discriminated against for their race/sex/gender/marriage, and we want to reduce harmful effects on the environment. Not to mention we don't want children to be held in holding cages and stuff. I don't understand why these arent issues we all agree on as americans. The democrats also DON'T LOVE biden, we are well prepared to protest his administration for not doing enough. But he's a civil person and he's level headed, and a much better leader figure.

Democrats don't even want to take guns away at all, just background checks so we can have more accountability. everything comes back to common sense. The right says dems want to up your taxes, but they only want to tax the insanely wealthy. and so on"
Like Trump doesn’t speak like he’s having constant strokes 🤦🏼‍♀️
"Yes, a stark contrast to the young spry Trump. Don’t get me wrong I think both candidates are too old. But I think one is a decent human being."
Trump makes Biden look like an elite athlete
"Lol Trump is 74 my man

Edit: and obese"
Appointing deserving experts high positions instead of just who ever kisses the ring harder.
">He's 77 going for presidency so that he can cross it out on his bucket list before he meets his coffin.

And trump's a whopping 3 years younger.  I'm all for getting someone who isn't an old white man in office, but since that's not happening this year I'll take a slightly less delusional old white man"
If you don’t see a path for Biden you have never take a math class. He needs 60% and he’s a averaging 70+
Where did you hear this?
You're misreading the numbers
There are 85k votes left in Philly alone and Biden is winning 95% of them.
Do you still think Biden can’t win Georgia?
"Lmao, give it a rest. You've been spouting this same bullshit for like two days straight."
"Over the past half hour or so, nearly 23,000 votes have come in from around Pennsylvania, and Biden has won about two-thirds of them. As a result, Trump’s lead has waned to about 90,500 votes, or about 1.4 percentage points (50.1 percent to 48.7 percent). A two-to-one ratio actually isn’t that great for Biden at this point, but that split had a lot to do with getting some votes from deeply Republican counties. Even then, though, Biden managed to break even in the latest batch from Tioga County (Trump has 75 percent overall there) and win around 63 percent of the latest from Crawford County (Trump’s at 71 percent overall). Bluer Lehigh County also came in with a sizable number of votes.

And critically, none of this involved votes from Philadelphia County. This is probably our final update on the numbers ahead of a press conference, scheduled for 5:15 p.m. Eastern, held by Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar, who will be providing an update on where things stand with the count."
Yes way. Watch it happen.
I think they stated how much the outstanding ballots dropped but not the corresponding increases in votes
I think there is more than 100k remaining.
"All the math is saying ~2% Biden win haha

Don't concern troll."
"Still possible ,he needs about 63% of the remaining"
"He didn't hear this anywhere. They're under reporting the votes, they have 200,000 votes counted that aren't reported yet and 320,000 more votes to count."
"I don't see how you came to that conclusion.  The stats I am looking at show an estimated 512k votes remaining with Biden trailing by 90k votes.  If Biden wins ~67% of those remaining votes, then the state will go to him."
Not according to the results.
nope
What is that username.
They say shit like what you just said.
How many countries are in PA again?
Because you are living in lalaland. Biden is winning the votes in PA and GA by 65-70% and at current rate will flip those states by tonight.
"Sorry, I stopped reading at “whilst.”"
do you actually believe anything you just wrote?
Hahaha. Good one.
"None of those things you just said are true.

Unless you consider Atlanta and Phillidelphia to be ""red counties""."
"The maps aren't telling the whole story.

1) We don't know if Arizona will flip. It's too close.

2) The counties still being counted in Georgia and Pennsylvania are Democrat leaning counties with a lot of mail-ins (heavily Democrat) still being tabulated. Statistically those two states can still flip."
None of that is true
"Trump fans are only hopeless from an outsider perspective, from the inside you guys are happy to be delusional"
"The counties being red doesn't really matter as they're all low population density thus, smaller amounts of votes from those counties"
"Because PA is almost certainly Biden, NV is certainly Biden, and he probably wins AZ and GA as well."
Biden is definitely winning PA with the remaining ballots being mail ins. Idk where youre getting your sources
Remind me! 24hours
Are you okay? Did you take you red pills this morning?
"Last I checked the US is only 1 country. Let me count again, 1, 1, 1 yep still getting 1. Let me know how your sourcing your country count so I can cross reference please."
Huh??
Have fun eating shit.
Lol trump is toast
Do you think there is a chance for me to still sleep with 25 year old Cindy Crawford too?
Nice try he ain’t winning cuckerbie
He’s totally got this
Link?
Show one concrete proof of voter fraud
You mean the hearsay that's getting thrown out of court by judges.  And laughing as they throw it out because of how ridiculous and baseless they are?
Yeah the judge in Georgia is talking about it. He said zero evidence has been provided showing voter fraud and tossed out Trump's lawsuit.
Show us proof
Walk away from Q
“discovering”
Prove it.
Don't you get tired of posting stupid shit?
"Where is the proof? ""people are talking about"" may work for Trump to fool his followers with his lies, but you can't convince the legal/judicial system of anything without actual proof. If there is actual tampering, no matter who it's for, it needs to be treated very seriously. No proof though, then it's just noise from sore losers."
Source?
"Hey mods, I found one!"
"Doesn’t count, you didn’t say *hereby*."
"That's now it works, Michael."
"What's up with childish name-calling, bro?"
"Well you just like him, are a loser."
"Make no mistake, Trump is the center of attention because he’s a giant, blithering man-child prone to temper tantrums and nonsensical statements. He’s an immature asshole who will stop at nothing to be right, especially when he’s wrong, but somehow that’s a positive for people like you?"
"This is just hilarious. Thank you for the satire, friend."
Whats that Lassie? Trumps in trouble?
What time is it in Russia?
"You forgot JFK, slacker"
Don't you mean #SEPERATETHECHILDREN?
Hmm.. all these codes. Let me look into this a little further to find out what it all means
"Lol, if he couldn’t get her arrested in 4 years why do you think he would this time?"
"Dems: mail in voting is safer and easier.

GOP: don’t vote by mail, it’s fraud.

Mail-in votes skew heavily Dem.

Surprisedpikachu.jpg"
"yeah, if they didn't count mail-in votes Trump would have won already! Next time, they should only count votes for republicans, votes for democrats should be thrown directly into the trash because thats the only way the elections will be TRANSPARENT and FAIR"
You do know you can watch a live feed of the count in PA right.
Counting of these ballots is no less transparent than the counting of all the in-person ballots that put Trump ahead to begin with.
Wow. So many bad takes in such a succinct comment. I'm impressed.
Thanks YOLO420_dropthebass
"bigger cities have more people, take longer to count, come in later, Trump areas have small populations and very quick to count giving him early leads."
"Voter fraud isn't really a problem, it's just something that Republicans have to pretend to be concerned about to excuse all the suppression tactics."
Thoughts and prayers
Go away bot.
I think you forgot the /s

PA down to 1.4% difference
\~44k
43K or so but the number has changed up and down a few times.
~39k
"90k still unreported, tho most of them have been counted, they just haven’t been reported"
"lmao senpai heaugijoklnda,.gbab"
Where you seeing the info?
"GA is close, under 9k now. PA seems likely."
Excellent
"AZ is doing a dump around 9PM EST.
NV will do a dump tomorrow around 12PM EST

PA/GA kinda seem to just upload when they feel like it."
Not Nevada
which one?
It’ll be close. Fingers crossed.
I missed it what exactly happened.
PA is still counting but the secretary of state believes we'll have enough counted to call the race tonight
Hes an idiot. Kissing Trumps ass
Military (in this context) I think is foreign deployed military and is a small % of the total vote left.

Lmoa more like a call to riot

No he won't. He'll be late. Make it 7 or 7:30.

"Unlikely. He's always been nothing but talk. When it comes time to put fists up, he'll run."

"Biden isn't winning enough % of the outstanding votes to overcome the Election Day numbers Trump got. 

Could tighten up a bit, Biden is averaging around 50%, and needs 70% to close the gap.

Probably should be called for Trump with 91% in."

Not finishing until the 12th.
No. This isn't ending gracefully.
the only concessions he knows are the ones from sports games
He’s definitely going to come out swinging saying how he’s going to fight all of this
"NO. Be more concerned about a ""Storm the Counting Centers and Burn the Ballots speech"" before a concession speech"
"Conceding can be withdrawn, it's not legally binding. It didn't matter though in the final count as she did lose."
It became clear relatively early that she was going to lose the Rust Belt and thus her path to 270.
That was a complicated situation. The true answer probably takes a few paragraphs. Democrats were too blindsided by the loss to make many intelligent decisions.
no idea
"I think it was a lot more obvious a lot faster she lost. The closest states weren’t as close as these ones are. 


And less mail in ballots probably let states get through the bulk faster. But that’s more speculation on my part"

Yes.  Its everything but impossible at this rate.
"Depends on the state. As long as Biden doesn't pick up PA, Trump can still win by picking up everything else."
Yeah he needs every uncalled state to go his way. Biden just needs one
He can win without Nevada
"Assuming he has Alaska already (he should), he needs PA+ 3 of the 4 remaining states (NC, AZ, NV, GA)."
"Pretty sure. Depends on AZ, some sources haven't said that's blue"
"If AZ is still a possibility for him, then he could win w/o Nevada. If it's not a possibility, then yeah he needs all the rest."

"They tried to allow mail vote counting before election day, but Republicans vetoed it deliberately so Trump could claim victory on election night and then they could say the election was being ""stolen"" afterwards. This was all part of their strategy."
"If the mail in ballots had been counted first, we would have been sitting there on election night watching Trump inch closer and closer to overtaking Biden. Things may be drawn out for much longer, but I think we're feeling a more optimistic stress instead of the existential dread that we would have otherwise."
I just wish this is over. I got that pit in my stomach that some crazy shit is going to happen and trump will magically win.
"While I still think it would be good not to have half the country melt down and cry wolf, I think it is very funny and reaffirms my opinion on their intelligence that they are doing this."
I think that but I worry I’d be still equally as stressed seeing the number come down as republicans vote in person.

"but it might take longer that we'd like: using data on the rate that Biden is bridging the margin here (i.e. how quickly votes have been tabulated over the past 6 hours), then running a trend line to zero (i.e. Biden takes the lead), it will take another 17 hours to get to that point.  That's assuming of course the margin continues to decline at the same rate it has over the past six hours. We might have to wait until tomorrow for PA to report enough votes for Biden to take the lead, but it's coming one way or another!

"Agreed. I disagreed with his policies, disliked the way he voted on most issues, and obviously questioned his sanity after his choice of running mate, but I would have felt comfortable with the country in his hands. Not happy. But comfortable. It's unlikely the Republicans will run a level-headed candidate like him again, not after they all saw the love and devotion that Trump received by being a fucking lunatic. No one is going to be competing to be the next McCain, or even the next Romney. They'll be competing to be the next Trump, because that's who sways the masses."

"Look at it this way, If, and that's a big if he did try to run the GOP would suffer.

His credibility is completely and totally shot to hell with the press.

And I bet he would have a hard time getting the GOP to side with him again.  Yes, he is a crowd pleaser but you know they were expecting to have a lot more control over the office.  Instead he broke the script on a constant basis. 

He could go third party, of course, and that would be a delight because that would fucking break the GOP in half. 

His biggest threat will be as a hate monger and rabble rouser, inciting violent incidents until the worst of his cult are brought down."

>Because mail ballots tend to lean Democratic, it’s possible that these could expand Mr. Biden’s margin, but we may not know for a week.

So probably depends (a) What counties these are from, (b) If his lead continues to widen, and (c) How many ballots are remaining by, say, the half-way point or further."

Yup. Most urban areas of the state (and country for that matter) go extremely Democratic. So Chatham County is looking very blue right now.
"Yes. Savannah, GA is in Chatham county"
Yes.
Currently 60/40 in favor of Dems to Republicans. The mail in vote should be more slanted toward Dems.
I could probably name more counties in Georgia right now than in the state where I actually live.
You're right. More like the last two minutes of a close basketball game.

"They dont realize they dont though. They are led astray by constant false information going around facebook, twitter, right wing subs on reddit and fox news that makes trumps claims become reality for them. We are in a information war with Russia and those aiding them in pursuit of subverting democracy in the United States.

Example: There is a picture going around of false voter registration numbers in the states that are close and they are all numbers from 1998 and such. Well they see these and think its true and next thing you know they are saying there is fraud which brings Trumps claim of fraud into reality and truth for them."

I have just been checking google but we lost internet at work. I went out to my car to ear dinner and hit up results on 5G and flipped out when I finally saw that 49.9.
"I also remember watching Howie Hawkins on MSNBC and he pretty much said ""vote for us in safe states so we can get funding, but dont vote for us in swing states, this is too important"""
"Yeah and that's totally fair. I'm more aiming my frustration at the people who keep saying ""AZ looks like it's going to flip"" or something similar. No votes have even come for hours so I don't know where they're extrapolating that data."
"Missed the news, I just checked the numbers and noticed! So much for blinking!

Great news : )"
What did she say????
Yes
I first wrote this like 14 hours ago and those were the numbers then
"Warming up in the wings, my dude/gal. Warming up in the wings."
"The big fight is never really over, but tonight the finish line for this small fight is in sight. Hang in there."
This was straight from the news networks. If the numbers look strange to you it's because these are the numbers from like 14 hours ago
"Lost two long ass time friends over trump. Support who you support, but if you support bigotry, racism, and all his other shit, I don’t need you in my life."
It would cut the lead to 3-4k roughly.
At literally 73% its not enough but brings trump down to under 4k lead i believe.
"Just under 7k net pickup for Joe, at 73/27 split"
Closer to 11/4 split.

"The other way around probably, but yeah, you and me both. Tbf, I don’t want to be labelled by a party either. Maybe someday we get more choices too. Maybe the individuals won’t be as important as policy issues then."
"No they don’t. They’re entitled to hold their views, and to be fair, as long as they don’t harm me, I don’t care what they believe in. But their views don’t have to be as archaic and ancient as the Mitch. They need an upgrade. Frankly, America needs an upgrade, but it can’t be forced."
"Again. Wishful thinking, but we need to start reconciling somewhere. This polarisation is a horrible phenomenon here in the US, and we need changes. Desperately."
"And we shouldnt let them separate themselves from Trumpism.  They planted its seeds, nurtured it, rejected out every institution, and people should never forget that will be what they always do.

Trumpism is just making obvious what was supposed to remain out of the headlines all along."

"I think there are *about* 37k votes left. Another user supplied me the previously linked twitter who is tracking counties and I grabbed a list of ""Remaining votes by county"" from someone who caught the GA announcement.  

Looks like Fulton is done which is the last line of data there. We've got Chatham, Cobb, and Gwinnett which are currently about 57B-41T split with 22,500 votes there. 

If those follow their current trends, we're looking at a +3800 into Biden's favor. 

Clayton is sitting at 6,026 remaining and 94.9B-14.2T which gives another +4,300 to Biden. 

Across the four counties I have data on that's a +8,100 to Biden. With a remaining 8,500 votes unlisted and only a -1,400 deficit, seems pretty good chances Biden takes it.

It's going to be close."
I sure hope they turn the cameras off like they did Epstein
They're just trying to get the attention of people at airports
"I believe it’s the county as a whole. Chatham is Savannah GA, where SCAD the art college is located. Definitely more left leaning than the surrounding areas."
"According to NYT, it looks like it’s the county as a whole. 57.7% to 41.0%."
That’s the county as a whole. It’s fair to think that the mail in margin will be better for Biden
"Fulton County reported, which brought it down to 9k. Fulton is done. Chatham is next."
"No, they are releasing them all at once. Chatham county has not released any results yet."

That started a while ago. Fox is too liberal for them.

Did you shove a peach up your ass?
"Basically.

Concessions are not legally binding. You can concede the race but after all votes are counted, you might end up with more. If this happens, you've won, even if you said you lost a few days ago.

If you don't concede then you don't concede, but the lack of a concession means nothing while votes are still being counted.

When races are ""called"", it is news networks watching the existing vote tally, comparing against past trends, comparing against incoming and uncounted votes, and making informed decisions about who is the likely winner (either mathematically, or mathematically enough). There is mild (but unlikely) possibility of the result switching hands if a number of news networks all ""call"" a race for a specific individual."
"Lose in a dignified manner, or lose getting dragged and thrown out in shame."
Yes. He's probably going to tie things up with a recount though.
Because millions of peaches are for me.

"No streaming, to the best of my knowledge, but there are a few places you can rent it at (Netflix, Amazon, a couple other sites). Worthwhile watch--Nicholas Cage does a pretty good job in the main role. Acting's great, and as an adaptation it does some very interesting things."

"NV is blue, in my opinion. There's no way for Trump to turn it around at this point.

Counting NV, it'd come out to a slight win for Biden, unless I'm doing my math wrong."
I imagine someone running up and whispering in his ear that  he lost. Then just stands there silent.
Damn that’s word for word classmates said too

Seems like we’re still waiting on at least 100 more votes.
"Should be doable, considering he's been averaging 70%"
"Georgia still has 40-45k votes outstanding. Biden is only behind by 9500 votes, and if you check the ballot drops the last couple hours Biden has been taking over 70-80% of the votes reported."
"I think that ship has sailed. He doesn’t need it anyway

But then if he gets PA he doesn’t need any of them"
Yup. Latest update just dropped
Any other year they would have called it and the person in Trump’s position would have conceded
https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1324473707121778688
"yes, but its going to be close, very very close."
It is not. But the remaining votes are mail-in which tend to favor Biden at a much higher rate than the general votes.
"5% to count. not much info other than that. I actually missed that one. 

Biden- 89,030 (84.8%)
Trump- 14,590 (14%)"

"I mean, if everyone did, but then it would be half that, but it would be half that.

Like, if your comment took 10sec the average comment time might go up a tiny bit. On average we would take in the same as an entity.

But if everyone's comment was 10sec, we would have made twice the money, so a 5sec comment would be worth $0.02.

It would be an outlier unless we spent (n)seconds each?"
Yeah lol I get it. Not resting easy until it’s confirmed.
"Yeah I guess I’d just assume the biggest bettors are taking math of remaining votes to likelihood things will flip into account, so it’d reflect fairly accurately the odds of the final outcome. Just an assumption on my part though."
"He's so well spoken, methodical, knowledgable, and calm, but he also doesn't take any shit. I feel like he would've kept the debates much more on rails than they were. Diaper Don is impossible to control, but he probably would've done a much better job."
I did too
generally in twitter. you can start with don jrs
He will never concede. There's no way.

"I get why PA is having issues, but whats the deal with the other 3?

Especially Nevada, it seems like they are doing everything possible to slow down their own vote count."
Yeah. That's why I also added az. But 24 hours and we are not seeing enough movement people!

Out of which Biden will get at least 200k
"Yes, but I don't think that would impact the timing of when Biden will overtake Trump. 326K is more than enough for Biden to overcome Trump."
Polynomial fits slightly better with an R^(2) of 0.6877. That would have Trump taking it.

They moved to an external site. Still a menace.
"If you look at the individual props, like Florida , they passed $15 minimum wage but voted Trump.  So some of it is just identity politics. The progressive agenda is popular in piece meal."
Yea last one was a gain of 3k for Biden! 3 more exactly like that or slightly better and we'll have a blue GA!
"Twitter will most likely ban the Trump family and some of the top aide personal accounts when/if Biden becomes president elect to save the companies ass in the new administration for what I expect will be investigations into them, FB, and Reddits actions in the past decade at least."
It's extremely hard to fight a cult of personality though.

"There might be some truth to that.

Considering how trump has been blatant about challenging the results and not committed to a peaceful transfer of power, they each probably want to make sure they're as accurate as possible to keep the public's trust in the face of an attempted Coup."
Most of them are claiming the elections are all scams and that since we aren't able to watch over their shoulders to make sure the ballots are being counted correctly that this is not a real election.
"Over not being able to ""watch"" every single ballot being counted. To ensure that they are being counted properly. Because it is ""very clear tampering is occuring"""
Oh for sure and I'm going to cackle with glee
Yes
None other!

"ClayCo is in the bag, Gwinnett gives me hope, fuck Forsyth.

Edit: 

Forsyth delivered FOR Biden by 60%. And ClayCo has 7000 outstanding votes where Biden is already winning by 90%. 

Holy fuck it’s about to happen!"
"I think they're probably waking up to the fact that they can only ride this wave for so long before it either all falls down. Or like you said, the crazies taking over. It'll get to the point where classic GOP types are seen as party traitors and replaced with Trumpian candidates. 

Trump is apparently unhappy with the lack of GOP support he's getting, so soon the narrative will be that the party is being subverted from within."
Forsyth will still have a healthy number of D votes.
"I think they are all mail ins though, so that helps even in the red counties!"

Honestly I like this better
"I place almost all of this blame on Fox news. When nearly a half of the country basically gets all their news from that source, and the information they're getting is tainted or just straight false, it's really hard to get through to people. How do we solve that problem?"
"The DNC also needs to reach out to working class White voters, and Latinx voters. Biden could’ve blew TX, AZ, NV, and the Rust Belt outta the water if he took some pointers out of Bernie’s playbook."
"Yeah.  4 years of Trump and they're going to win by winning at least 3 states where it'll go to a recount, even though progressive policies touted by the likes of Bernie Sanders are wildly popular, even with a majority of Republicans."
"personally I think one of the biggest problems for democrats was actually the BLM protests, and the violence surrounded those events.  Democrats believed that the movement for minority justice would  galvanize the minority voters, but what it actually did was scare the crap out of conservatives and got them voting in record numbers.    Democratic strategists needed to figure out a better way to sympathize with the problems of minority descrimination without alienating non minorities and law enforcement.  A difficult task to be sure, but not handled that well."
really true actually. I thought the same but kept it to myself.
I saw A LOT of caution with dems. with the margin of the polls. 2016 was still fresh enough for many.
"Sorry, Sos for PA. Watching CNN through some shitty website - so a lil delayed here 😂"
"They were asking technical questions that couldn't be answered without consulting data sheets.

The only one I think she should have been able to answer - that she wasn't even apparently aware of - was the one about the 7 precincts who apparently haven't reported ANY numbers. At all.

That's a potential problem. Maybe the reporter is looking in the wrong place, maybe they're reporting in one system but not another, I dunno. But that's something that should have an answer."

This. They gain nothing by calling it now.
Runoffs aren't possible in federal elections. It's in the constitution
"For different timezones, 530, is when from now?"
"I think that soon it will be enough to call. BUT, like you pointed out, I highly doubt they call it when it still shows Trump in the lead, as misleading as it is. Because they're terrified of the fake news bullshit accusations. I just hope they count enough today to get us to the flip so they can do it."

Yea right lol we could only be so lucky
"Are we talking about the same trump? He wouldn't concede the presidency if Biden had all 538 EC votes. 

Only way Trump will ever concede is if someone puts a hand up his ass and concedes for him Kermit the frog style."

Yeah. Who drew these maps anyway?

The fact that Barr will be kicked out of the DOJ and the FBI isn't held back in their investigations of Trump, and cooperation will begin again between the Feds and State officials in NY... There is a good chance Trump may be facing serious prison time. That doesn't change that his supporters are still there, lurking, but it does snip them of their idol. 

The fact that this election is THIS close and that we likely will not get the Senate signals the fight is not over... And that MIGHT just energize the base to hit the ground running for the next midterms and next election."

Out of 395K if Biden gets 70% that means 276K and Trump would get 30% which is about 119K. Which would end up with Biden ahead by ~80K. If Biden ends up receiving 90% then he would end up ~235K ahead.

"Its an amendment allowing the VP to declare the president as mentally incapable of serving (typically used if theyre in the hospital, etc) the odds of him actually doing it and it going through are unlikely, but I guess possible.

Edit: not sure who all is or isnt allowed to do it."
" The Twenty-fifth Amendment (Amendment XXV) to the United States Constitution says that if the President becomes unable to do his job, the Vice President becomes the President. This can happen for just a little while, if the President is just sick or disabled for a short time."
"the twenty fifth amendment (The 25th):  
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth\_Amendment\_to\_the\_United\_States\_Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)  


In short, its tells wh replaces the President if he is either unfit to rule, or passes away

u/Alex_0991"
"The president's cabinet with the vice president can invoke it and basically state the president is unable to fulfil his duties and then vice president becomes acting president. The president can contest this though so its not a ""legal coup."" Its usually used for when the president is undergoing routine things like being knocked out for surgery and the like to keep the chain of command intact."
Presidential removal for those unfit for office.
It’s an amendment that allows the VP to assume the office of the president should the president become incapacitated but not dead
"If the cabinet and VP decide the president is mentally or physically unable to perform his or her duties, the VP can assume the powers of Acting President."
"25th ammendment allows the vice-president and cabinet vote to remove the president from power if they are incapacitated or otherwise unable to perform the job. E.g. if Trump went on a ventilator from covid, they would use the 25th to transfer power to Pence so there wouldn't be a vacuum."

"I'm by no means well versed in polictical processes, but from what I gather he technically could, but I think he needs to consider the optics.

"The republicans have also. IMO, they did better than they tought in the congressional races, and Trump is now dead weight. I also think Biden can work with them, that is why he was brought in under Obama. They are not going to sing songs at a campfire, but when Trump was out with Covid, both parties were working out a second covid stimulas."

Yeah that makes a lot of sense tbh. Just cant believe that he could basically say anything tonight no matter how insane/criminal and would still be president for the next two months (although i guess that view could have been expressed at any point over the past four years lol)
Sorry ive probably phrased that part of my comment too strongly as it wasnt anything too major - when Trump was claiming all the states the other night it was quite pointed that McConnell actually echoed Biden’s “every vote needs to be counted” rhetoric instead. Didnt actually condemn Trump but suggests to me he won’t side with anything extreme

Or sad.. depends on how you look at it. It's actually pretty difficult for me to understand there's 69M people out there that would vote for trump regardless of their party.
Yeah if a senate runoff is likely they just might because then they wont have the power to protect them or they will jump ship now and try to sweep the last 4 years of aiding false information in the pursuit of power under the rug.

They haven't had it for a while. They don't even have the one they had for Georgia anymore. I think it's just too close to call anywhere.
"I forget, I never think of it as the south haha"
:( I think of it more of as the east
Not having cheeto mussolini on the ballot is going to do wonders for our chances.
I know! Trump only has PA as his scapegoat right now. If he loses PA - a new dawn.
My powers have doubled since we last met Count
If only he fought covid like he’s fighting the election results
Stumpy will hijack a bus and call it bear farce own and attempt submarining to Russia since busses and subs look alike.
They're still his kids
Ah right. That. My point stands
I feel like we keep forgetting about voter suppression in places like Florida and that Russian Email hack that threaded people that probably did take it seriously
I hope Biden wins.
Thanks ^^
"Ahh, that makes sense"
Some lawsuit by republicans about suspicious votes or something. Can’t remember the specifics
Gotta get them goons baby
Nice.  Don't forget your veggies my friend!  Especially the stirfried broccoli.
Me too!
"Simple and efficient, I like it"
I feel like it will be celebration
"👍👍 nice. I started making my own veggie burgers recently. Paprika, Cumin, Coriander. Sauteed mushrooms, add some garlic, few splashes of soy sauce. Mix with a can of black beans and add bread crumbs til it stays moldable. Make into Patty's, fridge for 30 min. Freezes well too"
"Well the important question here is, what liquor?
I bought a bottle of whiskey I'm cracking open once this is over"
"Sounds really good. I've got some teriyaki sauce, maybe I'll find a use for it too"
Oh dang that sounds delicious! Didn't even know I wanted some of that
"Taco Bell takeout is so clutch, not gonna lie. Enjoy the Mediterranean!"
Healthy and indulgent! Nice
Hope there's at least a sauce or a side lol!
Nice. Don't forget water!
Sounds good!
Oooh soy glaze sounds nice. So many ideas in my inbox now! I have to go grocery shopping
Thinking in that direction too. Maybe Shakshuka? Hearty and comforting
I need to go grocery shopping. Maybe Shakshuka? Something hearty and simple

I could really go for some pad Thai now
Mmmm lemon rosemary
Do you just mix the fajita stuff into the pasta? I'm intrigued ...
Can NEVER go wrong with tacos!
I'm not sure but I now have an inbox of messages of suggestions!
Tasty!
Love the mix of election stress + super heavy workload kicking my anxiety into full gear. Hopefully we both get some rest soon!
"I’ve been sober this whole time bc I’ve also been working nonstop. It’s a mix of genuinely not having time to sleep and extreme anxiety not allowing me to force myself to drop the ball on a few things so I can sleep. It’s definitely been an experience. I might get some caffeine for tonight though. 

good luck to you in your meeting!"
oh i’m on the east coast so it’s almost 6. i just have a vibe that this is going to go on for awhile & i have so much work to do that i don’t really have time to sleep until tomorrow anyway
"Honestly I agree with you, I'm probably reaching with the I quit! Rage too, but it's a weirdly not impossible scenario."
You mean in the bunker?
Agreed.
Your guess is as good as mine. I haven't heard any reason given other then its just when they'll be done.
It feels that if you were to catch him off the record he'd not be defending Trump.
I feel like if Trump and his family can say shit like “let’s make the liberals cry” then it’s fine for a news network to call them spawn
Don't tease me with a good time.

Supreme Court allowed late vote counting in PA last month. It's curtains for this fool.
Yup and left early

"Narrowed Biden’s lead but still ahead by over 60,000"
Favored Trump
"Biden at 2.2% ahead, 65k raw, down from 2.4% and 67k."
61% to Trump and he needs 57% to flip.  Lead down to 65k.  Looking less and less crucial but a solid 300 point showing from Biden in the EC would be nice.
Nutty
"Biden lead shrunk by 10,000"

Yeah but let’s see how it goes. Hopefully PA saves us the wait
He's had a rough... Everything.
CNN.
lol it’s like Grindr but for bears and leather people
it's a LGBT dating app. this joke is actually in pretty bad taste
Yeah I think the uncertainty about how many votes are in processing and how many waiting to be is an issue. The last three days have seen pretty coarse updates and reversals in that quantity..
Yep gotta keep those ratings up. I know it and I’m still watching.
CNN
"Growing up in Michigan in the 90s, this song was always about Steve Yzerman scoring a double overtime goal against the Blues in the playoffs. 

That is not relevant, I just have nothing else to contribute."
What??? Who was that? Budd Dwyer put a .38 in his mouth on national television. Super tragic because he was innocent and just dragged through the mud :(
"Its on on c-span, they just gave the 2 minute warning for when trump's coming on."
Question is how the Republican party will respond to this. Will they double down on Trumpism? Or will they go back to candidates like Romney and McCain who aren't fucking integrity lacking sociopathic liars?
"It's what everyone that's been watching Trump talk in the last four years would expect (in fact it was actually toned down compared to what I was expecting). 

I'm from the UK, living in the US and, although UK politics might have some bad moments, it's deeply shocking to see this. 

No honor, no dignity, no class. So much support."
"Yes but the GOP had a net gain of 10-11 seats, so Trump claims it as a victory."
"Most Trump supporters I know don't actually listen to him. ""I didn't hear him say that."" 

Okay, but that doesn't make it any less true."
"They sent out 8k military and overseas ballots. They don't know if/when those might come back. The guy was very clear that those ballots can arrive by tomorrow at 5pm, but no telling if they will."
"yes, i said enjoy the moment, you do not have much of this. Trump might act crazy later :p"
It won't matter if PA flips Biden just needs one.
"i believe there are still provisional ballots. The gap will be large, I would not worry much"
"They are a mix of military, civil service and overseas citizens. Past couple cycles they have broken dem.   
Our troop numbers that are overseas have been dropping as has the military's support for Trump."
After his last press conference i can't see any republicans wanting to touch him with a barge pole if he loses. If he wins though in a few weeks those comments and all this mess will unfortunately forgotten

68 million people voted for this guy despite his disgusting rhetoric.  He would be the most popular 3rd party since Teddy.  Let's not pretend he has no chance.
"From Russia? From jail?

Seriously, he won't be running again if he loses."
I just saw reports on sky that some republicans were furious with his remarks especially in georgia as they are a republican state and he claimed they were democrat controlled and in pa where they admitted they were being allowed to watch ballots
[deleted]
He gained 1k since this.
He's gotta hit 3% better than that across the board to win so any numbers coming under are bad for trumpo
Read that in Biden voice
Cumon Man!
"When the polls closed, Trump had a 100k+ vote lead. That has been whittled down as all the votes get counted."

Yeap. It's like he's looking in a mirror
"Afraid so. It's gearing up to get nasty. Trump is blatently holding off until PA is called.  


Then we're going to see a shitshow of a tv appearance and rollcall for fighting."
"In fact, if you are reading this comment, go check Arizona again just to be sure. While you are at it, check each and every state to be extra sure."
"Voter fraud, lots of yelling, a couple talking heads saying there's no evidence then more screaming."
You won't be disappointed if you do.
There has been a murder. There’s been a murder in Savannah

I think you can add some additional significant figures to that estimate.

"If they tie and Biden wins, the Dems have the tie breaker and should use it every single time they need to."
"90% of the vote left is clark country mail-ins, nevada should be called but it'd trigger a winner when Trump technically has a mathematical shot in arizona"
Cheers heater man
"Yeah I don't remember 'the left' talking about civil war and taking up arms if obama lost, though."
"Oh my good fucking god, man. I know the picture you're talking about.

Villainous!"
"not sure, I'm using NY Times which has 93% reported"
No fucking way!!! Never knew that. I hate him now
"431,735 votes remain. He is 90,542 down.

431,735 - 90,542 = 341,193 Votes left to fight over.

Joe needs at least 50% of those remaining votes. 341,193 / 2 = 170,597

170,597 + 90,542 = 261,138 (Rounded to 261,140)

He doesn't just get 90k and win.  Doesn't work that way.  He has to keep 50% of the remaining votes."
He needs PA if he can't hold AZ. Which is possible. If it comes down to Georgia it's gonna take fucking eternities to decide.
"431,735 votes remain.  He is 90,542 down.

"I just don’t know why using technology wouldn’t instill confidence. You could easily query that 1 vote was generated for someone that registered, entered their name, and entered their social security number."
how are paper ballots more traceable than someone entering their social security number and name into a machine?

Hmm same with Hillary. Although that makes more sense with Bill and whatnot
"Maybe it's because their first names are more unique then their last names? Except Barack, I don't have an explanation for Pres Obama."
"Kamala rolls off the tongue better, imo. Gives her more of an identity too, I think. Harris sounds like a generic politician name.

We do seem to call Mitch Mcconnell ""Mitch"" rather than ""Mcconnell""."
"I have a bad habit of calling both male and female politicians by their first and last names interchangeably. I say Barack and Joe and Donnie all the time. Also Hillary, though I think that started mostly to distinguish her from Bill."
Will she be old enough?
Concessions aren't binding.
A phone call isn't legally binding and you can rescind it. Al Gore rescinded his concession to George W. Bush.
Pretty sure you can unconcede if you want to
Verbal concessions aren’t a legally binding thing. Votes will be counted fully and the correct course of action will be taken after that.
Non-binding phone call
Conceding isn't legally binding
"Concessions mean nothing, they're a courtesy"
Thank you for those words. I did end up taking a break and it really helped me calm down my anxiety.
"It's recount territory, yes, but ratio of the ballots left that are in his favor mean he's likely to lead. If that weren't the case, they'd go ahead & call it. It's tight, but tight enough for Biden to overcome."
That's why they're keeping it in play. The ratio of ballots to Biden's favor hasn't dropped. All signs point to a steady pickup for Biden.
Biden heavily favored.
"They expect biden to win. 

Those numbers are just betting odds, it goes by how much you must bet to win $100."
"Since they're all negative, that's how much money you'd have to wager to win $100."
Negative return is good. It means favored.
Bookies favour Biden.
"Lower numbers are better - it's like betting on the favorite to win, so there's no money in it."
Negative numbers are good in betting odds.
"Biden is a huge favorite to win

those odds are based on a $100 bet, sorta like this:

-200 means you bet 200 to win 100

+350 means you bet 100 to win 350 

another way to express those odds is:

 -200 is 1-2 at the racetrack
 +400 is 4-1 at the racetrack"
"When betting, which ever option has a negative in front of it is the favorite, and the more negative, the more favored.  It means you have to give the casino that amount of dollars in order to make $100 (ie. -450 means give casino $450, get $550 (net 100) if you were right)"
"If they assign a - number, that means they think it's likely and are going to pay you less,  if the number is + then it's unlikely and you will win more, the larger the number, the better/worse your odds are."
If you bet $900 on Biden to only win $100 if he wins the election.
The higher the negative number the more likely that thing is to happen
The lower the negative the better the odds
"larger negative numbers represent better likelihood to win.  the odds are based on a 100 bet.  
-200 = bet 200 to win 100.

-900 = bet 900 to win 100.

+400 = bet 100 to win 400.

0 = bet 100 to win 100"

I think so yeah.
"Last time he did not go along with Trump's plan to send military against BLM, so there is no way he agrees now with such a thing."
No way in hell.
"Forgive me, but I don't think this is true. I can't find anything saying that, but I find lots of stuff about how southern states didn't want popular vote because slaves couldn't vote and they thought it wouldn't be fair to them, but they could manipulate the electoral college in their favor using slaves with the three-fifths compromise. Most states only allowed land owning men to vote. I literally can't find anything saying that states might allow slaves to vote at all as a way to manipulate the vote.

It was southern states that pushed for the electoral college because slaves weren't allowed to vote but manipulating the population count would give them power.

>At the Philadelphia convention, the visionary Pennsylvanian James Wilson proposed direct national election of the president. But the savvy Virginian James Madison responded that such a system would prove unacceptable to the South: “The right of suffrage was much more diffusive [i.e., extensive] in the Northern than the Southern States; and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of Negroes.” In other words, in a direct election system, the North would outnumber the South, whose many slaves (more than half a million in all) of course could not vote. But the Electoral College—a prototype of which Madison proposed in this same speech—instead let each southern state count its slaves, albeit with a two-fifths discount, in computing its share of the overall count. [Source](https://time.com/4558510/electoral-college-history-slavery/)

There are differences of opinions on some of this, saying that it was more about federalism or making sure a populist wasn't elected and similar things, but none of it ever mentions that it's because the popular vote would allow slaves to vote and their owners would force them to vote a certain way.

"That's why I said right wing and didn't say any party names, but that's still more complicated than it seems.

Republicans and democrats didn't exist when the constitution was written, so the pro-slavery origins of the electoral college don't have history with either party.

Andrew Jackson's supporters founded the democratic party, so yes, of course they were horrifically racist, but that has nothing to do with democrats today. Trump has called Jackson his hero.

This doesn't mean democrats were the ""bad guys"" in history. It was really always the north was the good guys and the south was the bad guys in terms of racism, slavery, and civil rights. If you look at the [votes of the Civil Rights Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#Vote_totals) and scroll to ""by party and region"" that's where you see the massive discrepancy in votes. Southern democrats strongly opposed it. Northern democrats just as strongly supported it. Southern democrats (who were racist, obviously) already had tried to separate themselves from northern democrats by becoming [Dixiecrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixiecrat) and taking running all the democratic states in the south as pro-states rights segregationists. There was not much about them that actually had anything to do with democrats. Jackson and his supporters would be more like Dixiecrats than democrats.

[The southern strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) wasn't really a ""flip"" of anything. It was simply republicans deciding to turn their party into the party of white supremacists. Dixiecrats knew they didn't fit in with democrats anymore, so it was easy for republicans to swoop in and say ""hey we hate civil rights too!"" to woo them in. People like Strom Thurmond switched parties because they actually only cared about racism and not the other political ideologies of the parties. 

The religious right comes in around the southern strategy as well since ending Jim Crow laws come just before the sexual revolution that championed women's rights and then anti-war activism.

FDR was a democrat in the 30s, the southern strategy and ""the flip"" people speak of don't change that. FDR's biggest failure was his racism.

Lincoln abolished slavery, but he was still conservative in his views of private businesses and banks and such. He was a republican in a weird time of change in history, though, and his full ideology is hard to pinpoint. I doubt he would take private business policies to the extreme they are today because I don't think he would support such massive income inequality. Trump and other republicans are being very misleading by saying democrats were racists and they are the party of Lincoln. The only ""flip"" there was was on civil rights and racial equality, and it was more about who appealed to southern white racists. Democrats in the north were already supporting civil rights more than dixiecrats liked, so republicans just became racist on purpose in order to get the white supremacist vote.

This isn't to say there was never racism in the north, because of course there was, but this is just a simplified explanation."
"Unless it's against Minnesota. 🤦‍♂️ NFC Championship, US Open Cup Final, need I go on?"
True.
Because almost 50% of American voters looked at this guy’s track record and thought “Hmm yeah that’s the guy I want leading the country another four years!” and if we are going to move forward at all we have to get through to these people somehow. Even with a Biden win we could get totally fucked again in four years if the right’s willfully ignorant extremism keeps festering.
Exactly!  Hit ‘em with the same shit they did after 2016
Hell yeah good for you! I probably won't drink. It's just hard not to consider it with all this mess

"What I mean is, this has shown clearly that a massive percentage of the voters do not want a competent handling of the pandemic. They will see any of that as unecessary, and as a violation of this right or that right. And the right wing media and online conspiracy junkies will spin it as such. There will be no evidence of any good pandemic policy, because if the science dictates policy, you will have the conservatives saying “see? It was no big deal,” nevermind that the numbers Biden inherits will be spun as *his* numbers and not the previous administrations. Meanwhile the house will be shit on again and again while McConnell’s senate bars people from filing litigation against wrecklessness, and goving tax payers crumbs while generations are stuck with bailling out corporate america again."

Biden is massive favorites. You'd have to put down 1100 to win 100
"Negative values are the expected return on investment— so a “safe” bet has a bigger negative because the Casino pays out less.

That is like 85% and 90%, respectively, odd for Biden."
You have to bet $900/$1100 to win $100
Don't bet against Biden
"Based on those odds, if you bet $100 that Trump wins, and he does, you would win $1,100. If you bet $1,100 that Biden would win, and he does, you would win $100.

Damn. That's definitely the Trump successor.
Idk man that first Milwaukee dump changed the whole game
I care because it is 2020 and they have barely counted half of their votes.
Really? Isn't that unnecessarily dangerous give the technology that exists in the world?
That all goes away if Biden gets PA and AZ or GA though.
How is this even a fucking thing in this day and age?
put fake info
The thing about ballots being counted if they are received after the election day. It was said that Pennsylvania governor or something went against the law and accepted ballots that weren't supposed to be accepted.
yes
"Oh I know he'll be late, but if we're faded enough we'll meet up when the time is right!"
"Don't have one since I was watching it on my TV. He said, ""If Trump wanted to end ballot counting, sure. Biden then becomes President since he has the most EV right now. The president should think first before tweeting."""
"I don't know that the margins matter that much. Apparently, if the difference is less than 1 000 votes it's extremely unlikely that the result will change. As long as we are over 1 000 votes, we'll be fine."
"I mean, Biden would be their new president. They want Biden, they get Biden."
"I have no idea what you're trying to say, sorry"
"The House has been trying to pass bills for COVID since the first one went through, McConnell tabled it until after the election. By relief, I mean whatever you would consider the first bill to be."
For real?
Can you explain what runoff means to me? I saw one Senate race that was close and it was suggested that if the Republican Senator got under 50% votes that something would happen. Is that what you're referring to?
"Yes, then lock him up after conviction! This person democracies!"
That the whole “#Lock(Him/Her)Up” thing is authoritarian bullshit and we shouldn’t emulate the alt right.
I think it’s unacceptable that this is taking so long when we have access to all resources necessary to speed up the process. it’s indefensible for a “developed nation.”
imagine you’re a two-brain-celled Trump voter. imagine states are at >89% counted for two days and aren’t releasing additional data. it is definitely emboldening these people. I’m saying they should rip off the bandaid so these violent freaks aren’t able to spin their own wheels further.

I think he will give a speech when he reaches 270 but I think he will wait till most states are done counting completely to declare and give a full victory speech.
"He keeps saying all votes should be counted, and I worry that Republicans are going to pull the whole ""both sides"" crap if he doesn't stick to his word 100%."
They are ALL about fraud now. They think Trump will win now by going to courts to prove this CERTAIN fraud 🙄.

He has to get a word in because Biden spoke earlier. He can’t come off as a beta. They even said earlier that his advisors have been trying to keep him from speaking publicly.
I doubt he would unless senior conservatives have said he has no chance or he’s too broke to pay lawyers.
"It was terrible, but it also made me sad. It's as if he's just now starting to figure out how elections work. Especially saying ""they're finding mail in ballots, it's amazing how one sided those ballots are""."

"True, but with much higher voting parcitipation and the vote still being relatively close it just shows how massively divided the country still is"
"I'm talking about the country being massively divided, not so much ""durr republicans bad"". An election that close would be problematic even without the two sides being as opposed as they are. As is with the senate likely staying red the two sides will just completely block each other in a time were decisive action is needed"
With about slightly more than 40k votes to be released I believe
1% of 5 mil is 50k votes left
I’m hoping Georgia can flip. I’ve seen that the Perdue/Ossoff race will now go to a run-off.
Yeah I think I agree with you. I think some Dems wanted to believe so badly that 2016 was a fluke and that 2008 would be the norm.  I have no idea how 2022/24 will shake out.
Oh definitely! Much of the focus was on the protests when things did get violent. Hardly the same amount of coverage devoted to the peaceful majority. This manufactures the idea that BLM is inherently violent which is not the case.

"Mail in votes are heavily favouring Biden, he needs about 70% of those to flip the state, and currently it looks like it's going to happen based on the fact that all counted mail in ballots there have 78% for Biden"
Thank you
What did they say??

Yeah midterms are usually terrible for incumbent. It’s possible Biden might lose both Congress in 2022. BIG YIKES
"Pelosi and Schumer need to both go. Pelosi is obviously a skilled parliamentarian, but the two of them are albatrosses around the neck of the party's messaging."
"During 2018, many suburban towns were narrowly flipped to dem. They flipped back"
People voting straight ticket in a presidential election year means the house will closely mirror the popular vote for president.
We probably over performed in the 2018 blue wave and then saw it even out through the Rs showing up to vote for POTUS. They have an advantage with gerrymandering and all.
"Republican gerrymandering. 2018 was a big over-performance by Dema, but the map favors GOP"
Hoping that’s true but I think dem will def lose more than they gain
I think Michael would join Trump cult for friends and be too naive to know what he was getting into.
Forgot creed. He has to be Trump right?  Darrell for Biden?
Great call.  I missed that opportunity
"She’s such a baddie honestly, so def not the only one"
"I lived in NC when it went blue in 2008.  I cried like a baby that night and was so proud of my vote.  Other than this year, it is the only time I felt my vote counted in a national vote. 

This year’s vote was in a solid blue state but I think showing a large popular gap was important to this election."
it's from the creators of dark souls franchise and sekiro if you know of those games
"Shapiro/Fetterman would be among the most fascinating primaries of 2022. Although with Governor’s mansion and senate opening up, I reckon they will each run for one rather than running against each other."
"Usually it’s reserved for kangaroos, but I’m not complaining I guess lolol"
Ah gotcha. I just saw people on here sourcing NPR numbers. Thanks for clarifying.

"I hope you're right, but what makes me think my analysis is better than something like [this](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html)is that it decouples each county and applies county performance to date to what is remaining to be counted. Perhaps there are factors that make me wrong--I would love that.

Here is a screenshot of my hopefully mistaken GA analysis:

Seriously lol I’m sure a large portion of this country would go over and help them because them holding on to their 6 votes this long *got me fucked up*
"That’s what it seems like! I’m going based off of this [link](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html)

I basically just asked because I wanted confirmation that he didn't find some other way to spew his nonsense.
Aw now I love him even more as a fellow lefty
What a loser. Really glad he is not running for re-election

"You misunderstand me. It’s like the bad guys (Republicans/Germans) were about to win and then the good guys (at the time) managed to pull it back towards the end. It was a symbolic idiom more than anything. Once there’s 1,000,000 dead on each side it might be considered literal but until then..."

I think no matter what GA is getting a recount. I think the final difference will be less than 2k votes in either direction.

Plus there will be military ballots next week.  Who knows how that may tip things.
thank you!
with the 2 independents how many of the GA senators do we need for a 50/50?
That's very good news.  He has been very conservative in his predictions
Been looking for something like this thank you so much!
What about some military ballots arriving late ? They won't be for Biden...

It's fake news making the rounds. Saw it on r/Trump but was quickly deleted.
Do you think there’s a realistic chance of Dems winning both senate run offs?
"That's what I was thinking... =\ I guess it's better than 48/52, but daum, there was so much talk about Dems flipping the Senate. I'm just so sick and tired of Moscow Mitch. I long for the day both he, and his poodle Little Lindsey, are gone."
"It now says 1,805.."
Back to 1805 :(
I kept refreshing and NOTHING new hah
"I mean, no new updates for so long will do that to you hahaha"
"Huh, usually they pin the new thread to the top. I didnt see one!"
"It's hilarious that you think a woman of color is somehow going to make it through a national republican primary season, and win. You haven't met many republican primary voters, have you?"
Nope. The crunchy ones retain their integrity whilst the puffs dissolve somewhat

"30, but same. I feel ancient now."
That is beyond awesome!
Eh? No I was just making random observations. Made one about Fairuza Balk in the other thread.
Samesies
"Well IMO makes sense.. It's just adding 80% of the leftover philly votes to the PA total. 

With 326,000 mail ballots left though.. that also helps Biden"
"From what I’ve read the mast majority of the remaining votes are from a Democrat friendly county, and Biden is already ahead in the state"
Thanks that will do
90k in favor of Trump? Fuck.
"You do realize **why** we locked down right?

I’ll give you a hint. It had something to do with an absolutely terrible president."
Ok fair enough. She wrote the book that exposed a lot of stuff right? Or at least set the record straight on some things?
"She's a badass. Not my kind of ideology and still remember her time with W, so I'm not a classic Nicolle Wallace fan. But she is a fierce and knowledgeable lady. And whenever she gets pissed, she just plows through with no single fuck given. She calls bullshit and lies and don't fuck around with the words to soften the blows. So yeah, I'm a fan."
"You can say that if you want to.

What you can not say is that he actually brings any value to the current situation."
Awesome! I really hope nintendo finally brings it over to america and puts it on the switch like they’re doing with the first fire emblem

Thanks! That final boss made me wanna scream I got so mad
"I thought so, which is why I was confused. I assumed this was the case since Arizona isn't fully counted yet"
Yes he has
That also is working off bad number.  Pennsylvania SOS just said a little bit ago the outstanding votes was about 100k less than that
"70% is based off the number the Pennsylvania SOS said on remaining votes, which is 100k less than the scrapper.  It's also the number CNN is using."
"yes, but still something to watch."

I forgot to say the snail is immortal.

Yeah I forgot to add that part. It's been a while since I heard that one.

It gives the president emergency powers to utilize the military within the US.
Biden is about to make this close election look historically different
Why would OP be concerned about a concession speech? LOL
"He's had four years of practice, and tbh he's kind of a natural at disasters.  KEEP PUSHING"
that's a given
He was down in VA when they called it for him. It's obvious he's winning it.
"Agreed, like I said I'm not complaining about him winning.  I just can't help but wondering how more exciting--perhaps less established--candidates would have performed.  Like Harris or Booker, even, not just Bernie or Warren."
"Everyone always forget this every year. GOPs in California who are ahead by even up to 5-6 points on election night are nervous because once all the votes are counted even that cushion is not enough to save most of them.

"Does this mean if the 200k which were counted already get reported, shouldn't this mean the 90k lead should dramatically drop?"
Yea PA
So is the 430k uncounted wrong then? From the github scraper?
Just go to their website. they are literally streaming it.
fuck I've been doing it wrong this whole time
that's it I'm not eating it til we find out what color PA and GA is!!
like 4 hours
In Nevada time 2 days
Yes
CNN is going to show it I believe
326k
yea that makes more sense ty
No chance.

safe to say that we all would bro

It would be ironic if his plan of fucking with the post office and incidentally military ballots hoses him
Both parties knew the election would look like this. He has been crying about mail in ballots for months for a reason. Also the dems kept saying don’t be fooled by polls.
"Right, even if things still went bad, if he showed himself as a concerned President trying all the options suggested by experts around him, and maybe even some compassion as things got worse, people would have backed his efforts. He chose the easiest route for him, hoping that he wouldn't have to do anything and it would fix itself."
He himself had voted by mail in the past.
I'm older so I guess I'm in the clear.
"Haha the east coast Reps being like ""Stop the votes"" while the West Coast ones are like ""Count the votes!"""

Thanks. Where do the remaining votes come from?
Yup. Needs to average 60% of the remaining ballots I believe but is actually trending closer to 80% that would give him a solid lead.
"This says 326000, but the other number is 395000.

Where do the remaining votes come from?"
Nothing

Biden by a mile
Over 270

No that's my wish. He hasn't even started the presser

Have they indicated that they will?
"No worries.. They've realized they need to up their game, so they added  a second ballot counter."
What is the joke about AOC and her feet? I've heard this before but i don't understand
recounts have ever only given maybe 300 max votes towards a candidate. If it's more than a 1000 vote difference then it's rather useless.
"I'm concerned that the process will fold to political pressure in ""red"" battleground states."
super chungus
big chungus
both

Hopefully we crush that 9k difference. I have my Spotify playlist ready
That would be the most breaking news in like a 100 years. Trump admits he lost.
If he gets those then game over
"Well, at the time when PA Dems is predicting 350k, my spreadsheet was predicting 400k margin. But that's with a higher votes remaining figure, before I revised that number downwards because of CNN - to see how much of a wiggle room Biden has. 

I wish I know what the correct ""votes remaining"" number is. It's a bit concerning CNN made that number much lower than I expected. But the other outlets - like Guardian - is saying 805,000, which I think is way too high too."
"CNN, on TV, stated 369,364 was the votes remaining number earlier today. You can see where I put that number in. Just a bit nervous, hope there's enough wiggle room for Biden here without that number running out while Biden is still behind."
There's still loads in phoenix and tuscon to go. Don't panic yet

By when did they say they expect to see it uptick again?"

Its fine. He won it but by less than he needed to.

"Fortunately Trump has shit all over a lot of precedent and Biden could follow his example. Appoint acting heads etc instead of waiting on Senate appointments.

Also he can and should be opening investigations into several members of Congress. McConnell possibly being one of them. His wife will be fired from her cabinet position and should be investigated - her use of the position to enrich herself is a prime example of federal level corruption and McConnell almost certainly had a hand in that.

But there are other Senate members who need to be properly investigated over their links with Russia. This wouldn't turn those seats blue, mind you. But landing convictions would set a fire and the Democrats have an EXCELLENT chance of taking the Senate in 2022 regardless."

Explain it to the Trump Campaign they're the ones claiming this garbage.
Someone on the Trump team threw that idea out there.
I think so too but the Trump campaign is pulling it out of their ass and he's been predictable by yelling something outrageous then doing it.
We are all stuck in the hyperbaric time chamber waiting for the final form...
I’m glad I’m not alone in that. Everyone is just so confident in AZ but the trend is not in Biden’s favor
they counted them first. Hence the overwhelming lead for Biden to start.
"That's not how AZ works. We've always voted by mail. However the remaining seems to come from Maricopa which favors Biden, but at this point I wouldn't be surprised in a flip."
Figured as much

The very first time I plqyed MGS2 I got to that point after playing for like 12-15 hours straight and it was around 3am. It legit scared the fuck out of me. That entire part was creepy.
"Possible but not probable. If Biden takes AZ and lose all other States not called, that  puts 269-269 tie"
Can I report this as fake news? Georgia goes Biden and everything else Trump is how it works. Based on the outlet you are looking at... this is still possible.
You need to play around with an EC interactive map if you think that's true.
“Going to go” and “has gone” are two different things. On your logic CNN should call it now.
It was such an outside chance that this race would be this close to begin with...
"Is unlikely but possible not newsworthy? They cover stories when there is a 0.0001% chance of an asteroid hitting the earth but doesn’t come within thousands of miles...

For some reason I have less faith in GA flipping.  I have no clue why even though I can look at the numbers hahah
"Sure.  I'm just looking at GA, AZ, and PA numbers.  I know everyone is confident about AZ, it just looks like it's closer than everyone thought"
Different strokes I guess...

oh that makes me feel so much better ... I was under the impression that republican controlled states (at the governship level) had some control over who the electors were."
Really? did not know that
Ugh my boss told me she used this logic. Luckily Gardner lost anyways!
Any sources on that? CNN reports 93% have been counted. Doing the math here leaves 200 k left. Maybe those don’t count the absentee votes?

That is a really solid point. Last week might as well be 5 years ago for her.
Seems like I'm wrong but CNN said if Joe gets 70% of remaining votes he wins by 40K votes. Let's hope we get more than that and there's no doubt at all abt results
"Thanks, I was more interested in know how it is done though."
Sure it does. It’s all about expectations.
Thank you! Walked away from the news for a minute and suddenly realize he's going to be speaking and worried I missed it haha.
Is there a link where I can watch from Toronto?
Is it somehow possible that the call was wrong? Has this happened before?

Thank you for this.  I wasn't sure of the likely makeup of the remaining ""chunks"" to come in.  And if Trump were to take AZ, that would bring Biden down to 253, meaning if Biden somehow only won GA, he'd wind up with...269, and we'd have a tie, which I thought was then voted on by the individual states, each with one vote, and we'd then lose because there are more red states...?

Am I overthinking this?  Please tell me I'm wrong and explain why.  Thank you."
"43k as of *right now*?

Wasn't that the margin this morning? That can't be right."

I second that. I've been refreshing that bad boy like crazy since someone posted it earlier.
Looks like he got negative hours of sleep
Thanks for bringing me back down to Earth - anxiety is making me doompost.
This isn't true if NV somehow goes to Trump.  Then it'd be a tie
"You're right - the anxiety is getting the better of me. Nearly three days of a pit in my stomach, I just wanna feel relief."
AP also called AZ early and they have a pretty stellar record.
That's what made me ask! Lol Shady saves the day
"Same, friend"
I can sleep easy finally
"Ok good. I was pretty sure AP was the most official source, thanks for the answer."
"Most of the remaining counties are from Biden country, so to say. That twitter account gives a detailed rundown of what's left and who won which."
Why?  And what does AP and Fox understand?  I'm genuinely asking.
Yet to find any good answers but I do think 300k is still enough for him to pass Trump.
"Possibly but they have results on their own site that match DecisionDesk, NPR, NYT, etc."
"I’ll do that, thanks. I’ve just been sitting here fixedly staring at NYT webpage and I think it’s starting to stare back at me."
Thank you!! That is brilliant.
My bad that was NV and I’m so tired. But thank you I already feel much better! I think it was the residual trauma of Trump’s recent speech lol. I’m feeling solid again :)
"Thank you! Logically I know that we’re winning and I feel pretty solid about the victory, but every now and then the little irrational anxiety speaks up! You are so right I’m going to step away and take a nice bath with a glass of wine."
"That's fuck me, Congresswoman to you."

"Okay, thanks for the info. Was odd seeing that."
That's very true I guess the two areas are pretty similar. I'm in Baltimore County and I saw they called the state for Biden before they even reported anything from Baltimore City or County - Howard carried it all.
"Yeah, you and “no one else” except Nate Silver and the election boards of every news agency that hasn’t called it yet, like the NYT.  So brave."
Agreed.  I expect he's safe from Fed charges because he does have money (supposedly) but NY & NYC have been getting ready to turn up the heat for a while.

"If Biden wins Pennsylvania it’s over, that puts him over the threshold"
"Biden. PA alone would be enough, as would any two of the other remaining states"
I can get down with Pittsburgh though. It's the people of Philly who have the low unibrow look.
Should've realized I meant they can count to 21 since some of those goombas might've been born with six fingers on one hand.
CNN doesn't seem too confident about it now. But I know Chris Wallace said Fox is not wavering on AZ being Biden.
"Trump: ""So you're telling me there's a chance?!"""
"I remember something about Gov, but I'd assume you know more than I. Fixed."
People downvoting a Steiner pasta. Y’all disappoint me.
Interesting. America needs to make the money machine go brrrt so hopefully Biden can find one of those left leaning execs.

But that's at like a hundred thousand iirc. These threads aren't getting anywhere near

I have seen much bigger threads. They don't slow down till 60k or so. We're not anywhere near that"
Or terrifying depending on what he says.
How dare you suggest that... he would be President-elect.
I know he can win without AZ but I want Biden to win them all!😂
"Yeah if Biden wins PA, won’t matter"

Its gonna be real close"

The latest vote drop came from ABC. Waiting for it to update on the NYT tracker. It's nowhere near 50k votes left though. Closer to 22kish.
Closer to 20k votes remain
I really wish that tracker would update...

Are you forgetting Rutherford B Hayes?
Excellent point lol. That wasn't clarified by the guy that was speaking. It seems unlikely to me that PA wouldn't allow any repub observers so I'm sure it's an exaggeration.
This may be possible.
That's my point. I don't think the states were ever this close this election. I believe someone has artificially made the states close.

69?.....Nice
I’m watching the live count and Biden is behind in PA
"Don't get me wrong, I still like bidens chances but what seemed like an obvious call for Biden turned into something still too close to call because of overlooking that variable."
So is GA for that matter.
"You realize those are old tweets that mean nothing now, right?"
"Did he? I’m not saying he’s wrong. I’m just trying to wrap my head around the math.

Edit: you are correct. He did say that. I missed it on the first watch but saw again that he did say add the 90k."

"Good Lord so this is just pure misinformation then? Toomey literally come onto CNN and started spreading shit about how “observers were turned away”, when they were truly there all along, at a distance. That should be CRIMINAL of an elected official."

"From what I’m hearing, it was 20 feet. Either way, very dangerous to spin this to “being turned away”, that is so different in perception it should be flagged misinformation. Average Joe in the US is going to react a lot differently to observers being 20 feet away vs observers being turned away"
How come they’re saying observers were turned away? That seems especially fucked to subvert the truth like that
"Considering that I, a progressive individual who has never voted for anyone on the right side of the spectrum in my life, really thought PA turned away observers is terrifying. What trump is about to say on air is going to be so inflammatory"
"My understanding after future research is that election observers were told to stay 20 feet away from counters, GOP sued and said that’s too far, make it 6 feet. Court agreed.

So no one was turned away, but the observers were just at length."
Because it’s 2020.

Her reasoning on voting for him and not a 3rd party candidate that was pro-life and a decent person was ""they aren't going to win"".

"I mean, I'm mad about all the other stuff too, but yeah."
Don't forget the massive tax cuts for almost none of us!
There write.
Lol I had a look at the conservative sub this morning and they were like ‘at least we can take it graciously not like those cry baby Dems’

"I’m not sure where that’s at here, but I believe it lol."
"Who would've thought having authorities gassing and attacking peaceful protesters at the capital would make them utterly despise you?

Though I'm shocked NYC wasn't the one."
What %
Yup. Unfortunately Savannah won't count their votes until tomorrow :(
What? 9000?!?!
"I think he'll pull GA, PA, and NV win. Really want PA called soon so the electoral college votes goes to 273."
"Fingers crossed. AZ didn’t have to wait to count early and mail-ins like the states that are new at it this year. The late numbers aren’t going to be as overwhelmingly blue as WI, MI and PA."
"Still around 450,000 uncounted votes that could potentially swing to Trump. It'll be close there."
Right and then deep red states like Indiana have their blue enclaves as well
I just want a sassy black woman President that won't take shit at this point.
"Absolutely. Black or white, men did this country a disservice by favoring Trump. I had the same thoughts when looking at demographics earlier today."
NGL peanut butter has been clutch
Have mercy on my liver.
"Sorry, does this mean Biden could lose Arizona? And arent values affected by which county declares?"
"2/3 == 66% > 60.46%, which [according to this is](https://alex.github.io/nyt-2020-election-scraper/battleground-state-changes.html) what he needs to close the gap

e: edited percentage for what he needs to close the gap"
Did you delete your main comment or was it removed?
I would expect that yeah. He was one of the only Republicans with the integrity not to start licking Trump's boots after Trump ridiculed and belittled him and his family.
"There were a whole 2 american Ebola deaths.

I can't believe anyone would even bring this up in comparison to COVID"
Maybe they'll run a sane person because evidently a republican candidate can spit on their voter base and the voter base will thank their god for the rain. Imagine the center vote with a republican thats any degree of affable.
"Maybe. I voted for him don’t get me wrong, but seeing all those videos years ago of him creepily touching young girls on the shoulders and whispering into their ears turned me off to him"
Nah he wasn’t.
"Ootl, why was he bad?"
I wonder if the the kompromat will spill soon.
[removed]
"Definitely. Despite the inaccuracy of the headline number, the info is important. I've been trying to get word out to people I know in GA as well."
"Yeah, it was a joke."
">Oh, and Trump leaves the camera’s line of sight, but keeps his mic on, enough for the nation to hear him cry.

Fuck that, I want him to stare down the barrel of the camera so I can look into his dead, soulless eyes when I climax."
Implying that would make any difference for his fanbase
That one didn't stop him on 2016 or 2020.
"But he is already broke, so that does not change anything"
¿Por què no los tres?
That's true. Maybe he'll win lol
SDNY DA's office has other plans for Trump and his family. They're going to jail.
"I read that PA officials will give a press conference in like 7 minutes, I'm curious what that's about. Probably no results but idk, it would be nice if PA got a lot closer in the next couple of hours.

And well GA definitely looks like it's going to Biden, he's making ground in that gap very rapidly."
"I wouldn’t be so sure about AZ. I would ranks them in order of most probable NV, PA, GA, AZ.

Edit: oops, thanks shaggz."
"But if Biden takes NV and GA, he's over 270"
"Hmm okay yeah, that's looking good for Trump then. Weird how they called that so early with it being a swing state."
Stop it!! You're scaring him!
"Ha gave me a chuckle.

(Mine too)"
Florida was purple. I'd say it's solid red now.
"Which doesn't mean an automatic better person is going to be the replacement. Neither party is very good on issues of privacy, tracking, and net neutrality."

Honestly thought they already called Alaska.
Thanks!
"I think they rotate the ranks amongst themselves, not sure of the latest"
"lol, lets not give anyone any ideas, it'll get added to a lawsuit."
"He could actually win with just PA, but NV and AZ would do it too."
Exactly.

Hey thats just fine!  Women aren't sexual objects whose only purpose is to make your tiny pee pee get hard.
"it should. America prides itself on being a shining example of democracy, yet the will of the people is not always followed. A sad state of affairs."
"""I voted for Biden, but I don't actually want him to be able to accomplish much"". That line of reasoning doesn't really make sense to me, but neither does much else in US politics so you're probably right."
thanks!
"Georgia went from -103,000 yesterday to just -9,000 Today. Have some faith and you must also realize that places like Savannah are literally using a warehouse with like two machines.

"yeah - instead they are only sharing the percentage of precincts reporting, which has almost no say on what is actually still outstanding and what it means for the candidates..."
"No, look at the 100k in total. Seven hours ago, it was 18,590 est'd 159,360 to go. With 110k less to go, Joe only made a net gain of 6k. That is too slow.

We need more of the last hour. Three of those and we are in the plus.

But it's gonna get recounted."
They never liked them. It was all business. They shouldn’t be surprised

"Ok cool.  I guess all I'm trying to confirm is that based on *these* numbers, there is an error in the table and that the Dems should be projected to lose 85,430 votes in the margin (not 8,543 as shown).

"PA SOS just spoke. Someone asked her about “anti trump tweets” and she said “those were 4 years ago, before I took office. I took an oath to not be biased in this role and I have upheld and continue to uphold that.” She didn’t way better than what I said - that’s just a summary.

/u/blue_friend"
The numbers I was looking at assumed Fulton still had 7k to go. Yeah it's gonna come down to the wire. 😬
Holy shit!!!! That’s fucking huge
Not yet. The pa sos said they’re counting till nov 20 due to all the diff ways of voting. But they might give us some more reports tonight.
Bruh that's weak to attack her about that. You know how many people Trump included have had negative comments on social media about an acting president. I swear to God reporters are the dumbest people in this world
"I got like 5,000 negative Pat Toomey ads and I don't even live there. Traumatized for y'all"

Trump cant be losing Trump counties and expecting to hold this.
Bless you my friend
Maybe they are afraid to call it first because of the riots.
We'll report more ballots at 9pm ET.
I did not think of that. I hope they at least get to take some joy from watching all these fools fight each other about who is the imposter.
Isn't the R^2 of 0.68 lower? Guess it's more linear than polynomic

"maybe you should be blaming the pollsters since they got it really wrong...again...its really going to add into the perception that there's this ""shy trump voters"" that doesnt answer accurately if they get polled or something."
"*and laid off the anti-gun rhetoric*

Biden has said some really stupid shit about guns."
"they can start doing that by polling better, asking them whats the main issues they think is important, their polling numbers this time was wrong again, they thought biden might not win all states but would have wrapped this up by midnight."
"yep, that'll do it. good save"
Thank you!
Ah fuck thats too close to call

Yup just risk losing credibility
Now
At the pace we’ve counted at so far I don’t see how they could possibly dump enough to flip today
"I am no professional, but everytime I try to explain what he says to my friends and family at home, I just couldn't articulate it properly."
Everything is ‘the best’
"Well, now you know."
Tommorow? How late is it in PA right now?
That should be enough if Biden gets over 60% of them.
48 hours worth?  What's left to say without the actual results?
"Oh fuck yeah, we got this!!!

Edit: if the times is right it’s over!"
"It sounds like Clayton (heavy Biden), Gwinnett (pretty hard Biden), and Forsyth (pretty hard Trump). It's gonna come down to the very last vote."

">And that MIGHT just energize the base to hit the ground running for the next midterms and next election.

Definitely. But it will be the same for the other side.

Remember how everyone was mad at Bush in 2008, elected Obama, and then got angry at Obama for the great recession, and voted GOP back into the congress?

This probably will happen again unless Biden finds a way to address it."

The more he talks the worse he digs himself in that hole. I can't believe we're so far deep in this trumpshit hole. Biden will have a major uphill battle bringing us back together.
"No, a suggestion."
"With about 25,000 left, if Biden can even score 50% which he’s been getting about 60%, he can do it.  Oh boyy"

"“Don’t read too much into it” is precisely the issue. Hard to find relevant updates through all the spam scroll. I don’t care what you personally spam, but I wonder why anyone is upvoting it."
The second part is worse for me - the initial thing could be tasteless hyperbole. After that he's endorsing killing 'traitors'. Bannon wants a civil war
It's a dangerous format. Apparently we'll have something akin to fox over here in Britain soon! Yippee!
"I'm pretty sure the more popular has been Fox news for years, although I don't check ratings these days."
I think we need to reinstate that law that says that they can't just straight up lie.
"Gwinnett is done. Clayton has some and Chatham even more. Floyd is red and has more too. Idk, If these numbers are right I think trump holds it by a tiny bit."
Ah ok thanks!
"Not your comment, the fact that an official would call Biden's team is inappropriate"
"At this point Georgia is looking to be the make or break state, could decide both presidency and the senate. This is insane"
Thanks! I had no idea this was a thing.
"Yeah, I meant that it hasn't been called just because of the modeling they're using to call races. It's like a sprint between Usain Bolt and some random guy. You know that Bolt will almost certainly win it, but you need to see a few seconds of the random guy run against Bolt to be sure that the random guy doesn't have a chance."

I'm just confused why you'd go to bed in the afternoon.
most hardcore followers are fat incels. Of course armed but I don’t see a big uprising. Trump is looking like a loser and no one wants to be on the loser side. Not even the people who were conned to believe he was a winner. Sadly someone will shoot people though but that’s America.
Cheers mate. Absolute scenes if he does it
how do you guys know he will win PA
We can't let them forget this.. we should be protesting to bring down divisive misleading media
thanks!
I’ll never forgive them for taking it away
Should have just declared victory. Then there is nothing anyone can do cause it was declared

"by percentage, sure I'd agree. I saw the same numbers you did. But percentages don't tell the entire story. Black people only make up ~13% of America. Overall, black women, at best, count for 6.5% of the vote and that's if everyone voted, which doesn't happen. That is a small percentage of the votes for your country. They played their part like anyone else. I am glad they voted the way they did and they are finally getting the due recognition they deserve. But to say they are the backbone of the Democratic vote is ridiculous"
You realize these people don’t just immediately disappear once Biden wins right?
Makes sense. Thanks

Oh you didn't hear about the baby farms then! Very eco friendly.
"Trickle down has no credence to it, it has been comprehensively discredited as nonsense since the 2000s at least (if we're looking at evidence). Paying the top more doesn't lift the bottom up anywhere near as effectively as progressive economic policies lift them. Sure it encourages investment, but it's no different in countries that have even less progressive systems. Standards of living changes resulting from stuff like innovation might still help the poor, but if they're practically poorer then they don't really help. Add the lumping of healthcare costs on the general population more and more, and the lack of reason to fund public health, and you get the 200k more covid deaths than countries that actually care about their citizens and try to limit trickle down somewhat more

Iraq may have been before your time, but it's still one of the most important economic events in US history, based entirely on lies, that the GOP fully backed, just like Trump was."
"I know of it, but didn't include it. How binding is it? If a state in the compact were to put its electoral votes for Blue but the majority of the populace voted Red,  I can see lawsuits galore being brought to bear."

True. I just want to be safe tho lol.
"he said he will rrun in 2024 if he loses, honestly if his age wasnt so high and hes not so overweight i can see it happening, but with his health i dont think they can let him."
"Hahaha. It's an interesting thought - does the Republican party keep wading in the QAnon waters, or does a moderate Republican party come out of this. Or do they continue to keep both? I'd have to imagine over time that polarizing candidates like Trump that excite the extremist base will turn off the moderate base."
As much as I wish we would lock him up...I think it's incredibly unlikely.
"They may not get to get away with going as full crazy as trump, but they know he's their cash cow. Use the power of looney birds to push even deeper tax cuts for the rich. The only way to avoid a fully GOP backed trump victory in 2024 is if he is in prison."
Right I don’t think it will be enough (and PA will make it irrelevant anyway) but Pima Co is heavily democratic and Biden was expected to win it decisively
Yeah I know but that was a blue county and he was expected to lose it decisively

that isnt ... AZ is done called for biden by the AP it aint flipping lol

"agreed, I know a guy who knows a thing or two about this, let me give him a call"
They also know what counties are still outstanding and how they trend to make there decision.
You don't need a social to vote. They usually go by signature.
pal
Lol he tall.about trump like he was a god

"I meant, why doesn’t he stay in his post and stop Trump."
Great question. Trump allegedly called Murdoch to tell him to get Fox to retract it and he refused. There's some talk there may be a break between Trump and Fox to some degree.
"Their goal is not to prove fraud.

Their goal is to get people to believe there is fraud.

Eric Trump is going to send a tweet that says ""We had X number of people submit to our fraud report page"".

Whatever number that is, people will repeat it as if it is the amount of fraud even if that is not exactly what he said.

The higher number X is, the happier Trump will be."

My guess is trump will bring some type of litigation to get those ballots thrown out, but for now there is calm and optimism for a biden win in PA."
"They can be accepted.

"I think it was the Military Times that polled both officers and enlisted. While enlisted did show more support compared to officers, it was not nearly as high as POTUS would like you to believe.   
Also remember that some military personnel aren't always a resident of the state they reside in.  So you can't say that there are X amount of military stationed in the state that are deployed so that means we will have Y amount of votes."
"Because if NV calls it now, we get to 270 votes exactly and the race is called. However, there is a possibility that AZ might flip to Trump, which would bring Biden back down to 259. If they call the race and then uncall it, all hell will break loose.

In the Perdue/Ossoff race, about 113,500 (as of now) votes went to the Libertarian candidate. Hoping we can get some of those votes and maybe some voters that didn't vote in Tuesday's election - if you register by Dec 7 in GA you can vote in the runoff even if you didn't vote in the primary.

In the Loeffler/Warnock jungle primary we had a ton of votes go to other Dems, Reps, and third parties. I feel like we will win that one more handily - even if all the people who voted Republican and third party go to Loeffler (which they won't), it would only give her an advantage of less than 200k.

The turn out is going to be key. All eyes will be on us and the mailers and the ads won't stop lord help us."

"Just under 67k votes have been reported in PA since I've been tracking. 

69.6% of those have gone to Biden. 

If AP is accurate that 89% of PA has been reported then approximately 790k votes remain to be reported. 

If Biden holds the ratio he has since I've kept track he'll end up winning 3.709m to 3.489m. 

That seems vast so I'm sure my numbers will be wildly inaccurate. 

Ultimately if there's 790k votes remaining to be reported Biden needs around 56.7% of them to take the lead on Trump."

Hello friend
If Trump wins it would still be very close. Less than 2K.
Republicans are probably doing everything they've been accusing every other state of doing but in Arizona.  Projection is their thing.
Not saying this Arizona race will be as close though AP (amongst others) also called Florida for Gore in 2000 initially.
The trump campaign is known to talk out of its ass
"Nope, I heavily believe Biden will take NV. He’s doing too good for Trump to flip it. That’s why I didn’t include it."
"I don’t think there’s been a reason to do so since it became the standard practice in the fifties. 

Republicans only became obstructionist in Obama’s second term and at that point why would Dems abandon tradition and precedent to lose votes anyway?"
But Anderson Cooper is fantastic.

"They aren't. The legislature chooses how electors are chosen via state electoral laws, but every state in the US has laws on the books that allows electors to be chosen by the state parties."
"State legislatures *can* pass legislation that dictates how electors are chosen, but they can't just choose them outright, because there is already existing legislation that prevents them from doing so. And even if their wasn't, in order to write new legislation they would:

2. Have to have either majorities in both legislature and executive branches or a super majority in the legislature. 

Realistically, AZ and GA are the only two states that could actually accomplish this *and* in doing so would almost certainly be recalled and/or voted out at the earliest opportunity."

"Per updates from PA officials. Already outdated now, but I believe the last figure mentioned on CNN was 326k to go. They didn't give a full breakdown, but many of them were suggested to be mail-in votes."
"Ah, I’m not factoring a higher vote delta. Makes sense. Thanks!"
"Oh sorry, it's something like total outstanding ballots times the percentage Biden / Trump and then compare to vote difference.

So if it is 480 votes D and 520 votes B 

100 votes outstanding and 5 come in and B has 3 then he is getting 60%. If you're averaging this over time you can calculate the rate needed to overtake based on votes remaining. If B keeps getting 60% then that times 100 = 60 votes."

"I'm doing just wonderfully. This should all be wrapped up by Christmas, maybe."
They do know. IIRC in AZ there is a ton of mail in voting every election so the assumption that the mail ins will go significantly for Biden has to be taken with a grain of salt. They are still expected to go Biden’s way but not as much as PA for example. That’s why we should expect a tighter margin.
Good! Wishing you guys all the best from overseas!
The big county in AZ is Maricopa and Biden is winning that county.
"Biden has a lead in Arizona of 69k votes. He only dropped by 1k votes in the past 24 hours, and Biden's lead has actually increased in Nevada not decreased"

"Well, the distinction has to be made between actual leftists and people posing as leftists is more my point.

But propoganda regarding ""dementia joe/sleep Joe/CLINTON assasination forces"" but more specifically the art of tactfully ignoring every failure of the republican party in foreign and domestic policy to blame the LIBS for things like 1) republicans using every power available to sabotage the Affordable Care Act in the states and in the courts or 2) blaming democrats for not being able to stop Donald Trump using Senate power while democrats dont hold the Senate.  

Lots of flaws within the democratic party and our country as a whole, resorting to making up one's that sit well outside of any realistic context or record is unnecessary.

Different from someone on the right claiming ""they want communism!"" and having someone who genuinely does want communism (not sure why anyone would, but not confusing democratic socialism and public services with communism) shouting ""yes we do!""

But there are a lot of people who conflate theoretical progress with tangible progress when its far easier to come up with an idea than to pass that idea as legislation."

Actually it’s 69% and he needs 60% to hurdle trump according to that GitHub. Lol get the fuck out
A total of 350 votes? 😂
unless I'm mistaken it looks like Biden is at 65.8%
Yeah pretty much
"I mean, what's the worst that could happen? A recount? It's just gonna show the same result; Philadelphia went overwhelmingly for Biden, by 80-20 and even 90-10 in some areas. Won't change the results and just further embarrasses these desperate fools."

"They've got land.

I feel like this goes way back to giving landowners power."
"Yes. Its changed over time, but it is currently known as ""Republicans""."
"Thing is, when someone says that a farmer in Nebraska needs representation, they have it.  Even if the presidential vote was 1 person 1 vote, and chosen by popular vote, they still have representation.  The president isnt the end-all for their representation.  In fact, the president is only a small sliver of that.

In that example, Nebraska has local governments, they have house members, and 2 senators that can represent them on a federal level, that can petition the federal government for change or funding if necessary.  But state laws supersede federal law on most issues.  If a farmer in Nebraska needs change, assistance, etc, Nebraska should handle that themselves.

This whole concept that NY and Cali would decide every election and that middle-America gets 0 representation is typical republican rhetoric because they don't want to change their conservative stances (abortion, taxes, etc), and use ""the poor farmers representation"" as a scapegoat."
"The 14th amendment seems to make it pretty clear that each person counts as one person. No more or less. So no, a farmers vote does not count more than a fast food workers."
"There are so many more issues than disproportionate representation though.

First thing I'd fix would be making them proportional. Not like Maine or Nebraska where they are given to districts, but where they are split based on proportion of the total vote, so that Florida, for example, would be at 15 to Trump and 14 to Biden. Completely ignoring 5.2 million voters because they didn't beat 5.6 is the worst part of the US election process"
"Farmers should have their interests represented fairly. And the Electoral College does that, but I think the numbers need to be tweakeked to better reflect other groups as well. How about this: each state gets 1 electoral vote for every person that voted. Yeah, the total number might change year to year, but like the only other thing we need to change is the name of 538.

Oh, they feel entitled to MORE representation? Well, how about the Senate, that is tilted in their favor. Hell, even the House isn't divided proportionally and farmers get more say. And it's lot like there are any special interest groups looking out for them. Or lobbyists operating on their behalf because there's money to be made.

And like, minorities in packed urban areas living below the poverty line have the exact same additional points of representation, right? So it's not like even with a slight reworking to the EC their interests would be ignored in favor of wealthy land-owning farmers and Big Ag. 

I'll stop with the sarcasm now: the EC is bullshit and undemocratic. One person, one vote. The only argument I've seen against it is that, if you get rid of it, then presidential candidates will only campaign on and cater to people in big cities. You know, the majority of the fucking US population, instead of pretending that some podunk farmer in Wyoming has an opinion worth multiple times more than someone in NYC."
"Would it be enough to argue that any minority should have some disproportionate representation? I don't know if you could equate an occupation like farmwork to skin colour, religion or sexuality."
why would a government ran by two parties relieve themselves of power in this way? They will have to be forced
"Yeah, my dad voted for Trump because ""Biden will take our guns"". A. That's not even part of his platform. B. That wouldn't be a bad thing even if it was. C. Trump has stated he believes guns should be taken from people without any due process."

Here is an article from Oct 31:

>Known as the “red mirage”, the scenario could develop if Trump appears to be leading in the presidential race late on election night and declares victory before all the votes are counted.

>The red mirage “sounds like a super-villain, and it’s just as insidious”, the former Obama administration housing secretary Julían Castro says in a video recorded as a public service announcement to voters this week.

>""On election night, there’s a real possibility that the data will show Republicans leading early, before all the votes are counted. **Then they can pretend something sinister’s going on when the counts change in Democrats**’

"The republican politicians in my state are predators. They just spin the most alarmist bullshit all the time, then back it up with some Jesus to let them know it’s all still okay. I’m worried when the numbers flip that they will try to get the people riled up. So far the republicans I know which are a lot, are not, in the slightest, calling for any kind of a rebellion. Most want to see the process done, a lot seem to just be accepting Biden at this point.

Still it might be being a Pennsylvanian but I don’t trust any politician as far as I could throw them. Tom or Repub alike. I’m just afraid once the realization of a run off in GA and the potential of having a tie breaker sets in, they go total. These people are my neighbors, they think how they are voting is truly best, I hope they wouldn’t buy the rhetoric."

Mark my words, with this current generation of kids we have being as progressive as they are, within 2 generations the republican party will be getting green party numbers if they don't shape up and jump way to the left of where they currently stand. The party as it is is incompatible with the growing awareness of and desire to address social issues that young people are displaying."

I could’ve sworn they were six. Eight makes more sense though.
Just so I'm clear. Are you saying that within Spanish-speaking circles it is preferred to write Latino/a than Latinx? Just trying to keep up.
"Of course, but we're talking about two languages which have very different suffix usages. English words are generally genderless, but latin based languages assign gender to most nouns. ""Latinx"" is an attempt to express gender ambiguity or inclusiveness about a group of people when speaking about them using the English language. While English definitely loans grammar from the languages they borrow words from, more often than not the loan words are converted grammatically into English to make it understandable to English speakers (Octopuses is English plural instead of Octopodes, which is the actual Greek pluralization as an example)

It most certainly isn't wrong for a Spanish speaker to use o/a or @ and not x as a suffix for inclusivity. They're operating inside their grammatical framework. That an English speaker is using Englishisms to convey the same message is understandable in my opinion. 

This opinion is from an English an Italian speaker, so take as you will."

"Yeah just that county. I figure that’s the county / quickest way to get Biden to takeover. But I think it looks like it’ll take a little more than just that county from what is left outstanding, that was my point. And since Allegheny isn’t counting rn, it might be today which is a bummer"
"Darn, beat me too it.  Took me too long to type. :)"
Same! I’m doing a postgrad degree in politics so thought I was pretty clued up - but the amount of microscopic details I’ve taken in out the demographics of GA and the country breakdown of PA is another level

I feel ya.. however it’s a lot of information to present and it’s nice to have it all in one place
I REALLY hope it doesn't--I've thought for some time that GA was going to flip and was disappointed when this analysis didn't support that.

"Ok, then for your benefit I will say that I don't eat cheetos with milk. With the caveat that I say it in the same way that Trump says he didn't collude."
I have always been weird about drinking milk with things. I LOVE basically any combination of milk and carbs/cheese/crunchy. But making cheeto cereal is likely the grossest of them. I love milk with pizza but they are consumed separately...I'm not a complete savage after all. Milk with saltines is a winner too.

they were having a screaming match a while back. it will likely happen again
You shoulda moved here 4 years ago mate
I'm so ready for this to be over.
"You're right. Sorry, I'm a bit on edge. I haven't slept in like 3 days."
"Yep. There are still many votes to be counted, and the gap between Trump and Biden is only around 26K."
"My pleasure. it's based off of the info that comes in to the NY Times, so it's legit."
That’s what you white people always say
Thanks my guy!
What ?!? Do u think im uncultured american swine ? Any one who is any one has heard of the emu war
That’s literally what the chart is doing. It says trump is averaging 58.5% of the recent AZ drops. He needs to sustain 57.5% to win. All the info is there just scroll to AZ.
"please do tell me, nate silver, where those remaining votes are coming from?"
That would be something. I don’t think the election will come down to Georgia but who knows.
"I saw that too. Makes me feel a bit better. Kind of wish I know where to go to to find the ""truth"". I guess PA's own website is as good as that."
"Nah dude.

In AZ, mail ins are a little more Republican than they are in other states. They will largely go for Biden, true, but early voting in AZ is different from the Midwest."
Ah so Phoenix mail ins haven't been counted yet?
"It's like a socket you plug into to get the data. He is using the NYT data for his numbers. I am a computer nerd and think it would be fun to have my own.

Then if he takes NV he will have 270.  Even if Donnie Dipshit takes the rest.
You do realize not all outlets have called the races that are called in your source right?
"Bud if Biden wins Georgia and Trump wins the rest it ends in a tie, I'm not saying it's going to happen but it is mathematically possible.

Don't be so salty."

Thanks for the well wishes :)
"No, you just put acting appointees like Trump did and bypass Congress. What you *don’t* do is make a Republican cabinet so McConnell’s feelings don’t get hurt."
I was just explaining further the information they were looking for
">republicans using every power available to sabotage the Affordable Care Act in the states and in the courts

Not just in the states and in the courts, but also over 100 Republican amendments that were added to the ACA legislation alone. And the supposed main reason why Democrats even tried to pass Romneycare in the first place (to get Republican votes) didn't happen anyway, so they might at least tried to pass something better in the first place or at least not passed those Republican amendments. 

The Dem-controlled House also passed a bill in 2019 that repealed some parts of Obamacare, mainly the funding vehicles for subsidies - medical device tax and the Cadillac tax. So Obamacare will be even more expensive in the future, thanks to the Dem majority. Thankfully, the unrealistic and crazy Dem Squad (AOC, Omar, Tlaib) voted against this partial Obamacare repeal.

-

>blaming democrats for not being able to stop Donald Trump using Senate power while democrats dont hold the Senate.

We don't know if this was or wasn't possible, because it wasn't even attempted. Instead of at least slowing down the Senate, Schumer went in the opposite direction and fast-tracked a lot of judges, including Amy Coney Barrett herself in 2017. Of course, after 2019, Democrats had the power to basically stop anything that Trump wanted, but continued to pass lots of Trump's priorities, including his insane war budget with ""smaller nukes"" and more money for DHS/ICE with no attached preconditions to that money.

-

>But there are a lot of people who conflate theoretical progress with tangible progress when its far easier to come up with an idea than to pass that idea as legislation.

Having people who actually support that idea is the first step in passing that idea as legislation. You are basically using a circular argument. We shouldn't vote for people who want X because there are not enough votes to pass X and because there are not enough votes to pass X we shouldn't vote for people who want X is a circular argument. The only way for that argument to make sense if you don't actually support X, but don't want to directly say that."
I'm at work and saw something about them casting doubt on recent trends in AZ. I'm at work and couldn't catch it all but it seems everyone in this threads thinks AZ is a lock.
It really does lol
it was so obvious though -_-
"Bet turtleman would still block it. Pretty sure all of Biden's people will be ""acting"" for at least the first 2 years"
Probably going to claim voter fraud and victory
he doesn't pay his lawyers anyway
"Agreed,  I can understand why people are concerned about the trends, but AP and Fox have been adamant about their call."
"Fuck no, just defund your county and let you make your own choice."
Understood
I think they have a giant batch of ballots and they are purposely making Trump and Biden tie and throwing out the rest.
Whis the one being attacked?
If its anything like the storys my uncle used to give me then ill pass
"No.
He did 52% 65% 47%and 78% with 6907.
He should've been doing 4765 out of 6907 but he only did 4075. 
Doing the math, if he keeps that trend which he has been doing(taking the average of last batches instead of the whole election), he won't make up the difference. Best he could do is tie"
I have a fear it goes to the Supreme Court and absolute bullshit gets ruled 5-4. I don’t think Gorusch would make such a ruling though
You're trying to throw away the baby with the bath water by lumping in the flying in claim.  If Portland hasn't been burning why was the National Guard finally allowed to be sent in last night?🤔
"He is only ahead by a couple of votes, can't celebrate yet."
"It was just one more thing to cross of the list like “ok, at least I know I didn’t eff that up.” Best of luck!"
"No... It's because if they don't have more representation then they don't receive infrastructure they need. No one is going to supply water treatment, power, roads, etc if the voter doesn't matter compared to a city voter."
I wish I could guild you
"He means a that because of how the electoral college works a person in one states vote is more important than another. Not that their vote is literally viewed as being, to pick a random number, 3/5ths as valuable."
"Yeah, I’m a Dual US/UK citizen. People in the UK constantly complain that parliamentary constituencies are FTPT and there’s no proportional representation, but those constituencies typically represent a few thousand people. The idea that millions of people vote for a Senator and get no representation becUsr they lose by a few thousand votes is nuts"
"They won't.   But ranked choice would be better for the country in the long run, imo."
Pennsylvania wasn't.
Why research when you can be spoon fed by the party of obstruction?
Expect concentrated ratfucking.
"Keep that fucking turtle plastered all over reddit. Don't let anyone forget his face for a second until January. I'm sure the democrats are gonna be throwing money at georgia like that was her stage name. I know I'm gonna donate as much as I can, and I'd urge everyone who gives even a fraction of a fuck about this to do the same.

We need these seats. I can't stress this point enough. If we don't get these seats then we may as well have just put a loaf of bread in the oval office for as much as they'll let him accomplish. TAKE THE SENATE. NEUTRALIZE THE PALE MAN. GEORGIA IS THE KEY."
I have no clue. I don't think that would lead to thousands of extra ballots. I guess the amount left to vote is just an estimate and so sometimes they'll realize they had more than they thought.
"Ah right. It's pretty weird to see it go up with thousands at a time, though."
"It's swedishfish007 on reddit. He posts a comment in every thread which he updates every time new info comes out. His comment in this thread was removed or deleted but you can still see it on his profile.

I can't link to his profile because that's not allowed apparently."
"I've tried to calmly explain this to the Republicans I know but they literally refuse to believe it. 

Their cult leader Trump said it's the evil Democrats stealing the election so that *is* the truth. End of story."
"I thought this would make me feel better, but it seems to have added a bit to the stress."
"The bulk of the mail-ins were counted early. These are ones that arrived after early voting was concluded, were dropped off by hand, or that failed the initial signature verification."
"No.. and your recent comment about the flip% in part 48 also doesn't show up, nor your comment in part 47."
Can you clearly and concisely state your issue?
It went blue for Obama in '08 and '12. In '16 it went to Trump by a hairline margin. Now it went solid red for Trump.
Me neither but here we are :)
"Easier, sure. A useful repost? Meh."
Oof ok thanks
So there was never 51 states? I guess I’m being Mandela Effected
"""If"" their views hurt anyone? Did you see their response to COVID? Keep in mind I have fucking lost relatives to this disease and I daily see people treating it like a joke because of the shit Trump and the GOP members say. You're wringing your hands about making these people feel loved while telling my family to go fuck themselves and die. I'm not talking about bedroom antics, I'm talking about the real world, hard decisions that they have proven themselves incapable of making.

I'm not going to continue talking to you. Fuck off"
"It's more a condemnation of politicians as a whole.  Rather than working to solve problems and address concerns they work to preserve or improve thier position of power.

I understand, it's just laughable that they thought Donald Trump was going to have anyone but his own interests at heart."
I have not read asimov but have some pending in kindle. Foundation is his right?
No offense taken! If you have any hidden-gem recommendations I’m always looking for more
Really? That's definitely great to hear.
"similarly, CNN has become more and more liberal its not even balanced anymore."
"You're never going to ""solve"" it, the best that can happen is that their influence is minimized. The fact the U.S. allows ""freedom of speech"" regardless of whether it's truthful, is a double edged sword as it permits this type of nonsense. 
Therefore if you can't eliminate the ""speech"", then the only alternative is to educate enough people to apply critical thinking to help discern what is true and what is bullshit. 
The other alternative is to organize enough people to put significant pressure on their advertisers. If the dollars dry up, the content either changes or disappears."
"Precisely. I understand that it's a big deal for a lot of people in the far left, but the reality is that they need to play to the center on a lot of issues. 

On fiscal policy I think the Democrats can get away with a lot of social programs before people start to really get uncomfortable with it. However, it's a problem when they meld that kind of thing with a harsh rhetoric on the Second Amendment. There are a lot of single issue 2A voters out there who were essentially looking for *any* reason not to vote for Trump, but they just couldn't get around it. I disagree with their thinking on that, but that's the way that they vote. 

I think a lot of this simply stems from a basic ignorance of firearms, and I wish that the Democratic Party would put programs in place to actually educate their candidates on on sport shooting, hunting, and the necessity of defense from both criminals and a tyrannical government. In my opinion, Trump's presidency is one of the greatest justifications for a strong observance of the Second Amendment that I've ever seen."

Thank you. So it's not too bad. That's good.
Exactly! It’s so weird!
Hm interesting  cheers for the info 👍
No you’re actually suggesting the same partisan retaliation Trump is. That will totally make things better...
"Yeah, just saw Cumberland (R+11) Just came in 66/33 for Biden. Guess that ""don't vote by mail"" message was received loud and clear by Trump's supporters."
"The way our aboriginal population is treated is quite frankly disgusting. Casual racism extends through all tiers of society. There just seems to be a general lack of respect for our indigenous.

This means they’re born into underprivileged situations. Even the ones that do manage to claw their way out, find it near impossible to get anywhere because all the casual prejudices against them.

Our indigenous people start life so far behind, because of centuries of suppression that is nowhere near being rectified. Meanwhile our wealthy white families raise wealthy white, well educated children who have a great start in life.

NZ isn’t perfect, but it’s a heck of a lot more perfect when it comes to indigenous relations and culture than Australia."
"Never worth arguing like nutters, ultimately, because I want you to question your views, and if I'm wrong, I want to be able to be challenged sanely, too!

The thing is that fixing those safety nets *is* the 'socialism' that Americans fear, because after at least 30 years of factually incorrect understandings of what socialism is, it has become a bogeyman, not a genuine concept, and social democracy appears as socialism, which is simply not true. The Democrats are the rest of the world's centre right, like Bernie Sanders could run as a moderate in the UK Labor party!!!"
"That's true - I'm thinking that over time, the party will start to split similar to how there's a growing number of elected progressives in the Democratic party. Eventually, there's going to be an identity complex there, and I can see down the line the entire Republican party is going to go hard right, or there might be some sort of awakening of softer, more relatable Republicans."
"Yeah I think so

But I wouldn’t put any faith in what I say. Been wrong about a lot"
"Yeah though I think it’s more about whether they’re doing mail in, drop off, or in person ballots"
Correct. If Biden gets Pa it’s game over
no hope needed. once nevada is done doing what ever its doing biden wins
"Not every elligible voted has a social. 

I'll give you an example. I'm from MN. In MN we always have very high voter turnout. And voter fraud is virtually non existent. We are able to handle the votes without needing an ID or a social to vote. It works very well. And the only time we had to wait for results for days during my lifetime was due to a recount when al Franken first won. Because it was like less than 500 vote margin.

It works great here and we have zero issues with safety or taking too long to vote or taking too long to count the votes.

We have systems that work. No need to reinvent the wheel. 

The problem is some states deliberately make it take longer but passing laws that don't allow the votes for be counted until a certain time. That's the issue."
Ofc we care people can say what they want about the last four years reputation but fact is the world still looks upto them like the big daddy usa aint gone its just gone through a rough patch and i hope they know the world is still here waiting to celebrate with them. It could be another day or so for some results its ok to have a break and rest.
No. Not sure if military is included in that number either.
"You think just because someone votes Dem they where a mask?

We seriously need a better education system in the US to prevent this in the future. Stop teaching the mythology of the US and teach the real dirty history of the US.
"Well, TIL, thanks man."
Now I am starting to wondering if you are an astroturfing Trump supporter just trying to get that number as high as possible.
"Take this with a grain of salt, because I only speak English and a bit of Italian, but yes. That, or just only using masculine, which is less sexist than it sounds from a linguistic standpoint."
"> This opinion is from an English an Italian speaker, so take as you will.

Anch'io parlo un po' d'italiano. I'm basing a lot of my statements here on what I remember seeing in Italian, where you even need things like -o/i instead of -o(s) because it's south of the La Spezia-Rimini line. I'd definitely expect something like -o/a when trying to be inclusive, although now I want to quickly start up a new game in Pokémon XY/SM/USUM and see how the introduction handles gender. I.e. does it just say ""Bienvenido al mundo de pokémon"" or similar, or what?"
"Basically, it's another case like ""people with autism"" where it's largely people outside the community using it, while within the community, opinions tend to be neutral at best."

If they’re right then that should mean good news for us"
Yes served in the navy with the Marines but why not a Army Helmet. Why Marines? I have just never heard anyone call it a Marine Helmet. Its cool. Was just confused about the Marines part
i think the plan is to convince his base to kill people and then pause the election giving trump time to cheat
"Me, go to NV on PURPOSE? No way José."
Horse radish and radish? Lmao what?
Thoughtless comment.
"Yeah but what difference would that make for NV? Unless your suggesting that NV republican leaders are slowing counts... to... what, delay the inevitable...? That’s also assuming they’re in a position to do so in the first place.

"The emu war never technically ended to my knowledge, there was never an armistice."
now factor in where the remaining votes are coming from
In the sense that Biden may win it and further establish an over 270 lead. It may. I don't think it will be the game winner.  But I think at this point we just want to hear the words.
"Yeah, it really does seem like this is all way more complicated than it needs to be."
Oh yeah for sure but Trump needs to go at a 59% rate from here on out. He's above it for now but I doubt it will stay that way

"Acting appointees can’t pass laws.  They can’t push Biden’s tax plan through.  Cant expand on the ACA.  Cant fix corporate campaign donations.

If Biden wants any chance of actually getting anything of substance done, he’s got to find a way to compromise.  I’m not saying by appointing republicans.  But a compromise must happen somewhere."
Right on
"Yes, precisely, blaming democrats for Amy Comey Barrett is exactly what the republicans want you to do.

Thank you for making my point better that I could.

And no I didnt say people shouldnt support progressive ideas - this is just you resorting to strawman arguments because youve got nothing to argue here.

We lost decades of progress in 2016 and didnt elect anyone with progressive ideas.  

But you wanting to blame Schumer for appointing judges appointed by the Trump administration is you doing everything you blame the libs for doing - just serving your duty as a Trump apologist by blaming the actual left while you bootlick republican ideology.

Americans really appreciate all that theoretical progress youve made though, wow.  What a different America it is today! THX for your hard work typing. /s

Democrats have their flaws, but if you dont want Republicans to appoint judges, help keep them out of office."

"Yep it's gonna be razor thin. On one hand, Biden can win it. On the other hand, he could lose by such an insultingly slim margin.

My point is more so OK we have 400,000,000 Americans (whatever the total is) so why not just give every citizen a 9-digit number that aligns with their name? Seems perfectly reasonable to me. I am Citizen number 065,233,890 and my first name is MF and my last name is GLOOM, any vote that doesn’t satisfy both of those data points is invalid and discarded"

"I'm not sure, but it's worth noting that other media still hasn't called it and on CNN they even said Trump was on track to meet Biden in AZ. Also Republicans do a lot of mail voting in AZ, so the late results are different from other states, here's a better explanation https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1324404334159896579

Also, all I wanted to show was that betting sites were giving Biden a bigger chance to win GA than AZ, which is very interesting since GA has been hovering around 50-60% chance and is now nearly 80%. Not sure why you're replying to me like I think Trump will win Arizona, I don't. Biden still has >75% to win there, after all. I just wanted to showcase the good progress in GA by comparing it to AZ."
We really do. Hopefully the next 4 years will be just that.
No idea.
Idk what that is. I’m not racist like you
"Maricopa county, which went to Trump by 50k in 2016. These are Monday and Tuesday mail ins/drop offs so they are last minute which can trend more toward a Trump voter. 

Not saying he’s 100% going to take it but it’s possible based on these numbers."
Very true. I feel most of the country is hungry for a call of any kind after not getting anything for 24 hours. The Nevada put off until Friday is especially frustrating.
And you think there's good reason to believe that the 60% he's been getting now is coming from areas that he was expected to do so anyway?
"Ah so it is mathematically possible, got it.

Because I’m pretty sure when things become mathematically impossible all outlets make the call because it can only be one way."
"Arizona isn't called everywhere, if Tump wins that and everything else but Georgia, it can end in a tie. So yes, it is possible. It has nothing to do with the congressional districts. Those are already determined."
"We’re talking about cabinet appointments. Republicans have shown they’re not engaging in good faith time and time again, so playing ball when he doesn’t even need to exposes how weak he is. At this rate, you may as well have elected a Republican if all he’ll do is Republican-approved."
">Yes, precisely, blaming democrats for Amy Comey Barrett is exactly what the republicans want you to do.

They literally fast-tracked her nomination and nominations of dozens of other judges in 2017. What is the problem here?

>We lost decades of progress in 2016 and didnt elect anyone with progressive ideas.


Yes, why did we run that crazy far-left unrealistic Medicare-for-all supporting Iraq-war-opposing Hillary Clinton in 2016?

>But you wanting to blame Schumer for appointing judges appointed by the Trump administration is you doing everything you blame the libs for doing - just serving your duty as a Trump apologist by blaming the actual left while you bootlick republican ideology.

I made a really factual statement, what is your problem here? Why did Schumer have to fast-track Republican judges?

>Americans really appreciate all that theoretical progress youve made though, wow. What a different America it is today!

Hard to make progress when libs oppose you even after their ""most competent ever"" candidate loses to a game show host in 2016. Not only that, libs literally rolled back parts of Obamacare in 2019 LMAO. The Dem-controlled House passed a bill in 2019 that repealed some parts of Obamacare, mainly the funding vehicles for subsidies - medical device tax and the Cadillac tax. So Obamacare will be even more expensive in the future, thanks to the Dem majority. Thankfully, the unrealistic and crazy Dem Squad (AOC, Omar, Tlaib) voted against this partial Obamacare repeal.

>And no I didnt say people shouldnt support progressive ideas - this is just you resorting to strawman arguments because youve got nothing to argue here.

I only noted that you were making an inherently circular argument. OK, so you support progressive ideas, but think we shouldn't vote for and elect candidates who support those ideas?"
They have impressed the crap out of me this election.
"That's fine, live in the county that's been adjusted so the taxes are distributed fairly. Right now rural (trump country) counties get $1.50 back for every dollar of taxes they pay. That needs to end."
Thats good but I still have such a bad feeling about it. I was so confident when it was called but now im just thinking there was an error. I have a terrible feeling Georgia wont flip and trump will take AZ and PA will go down to the wire. My god im so stressed rn
Logically I would say there is no way this gets through. But something tells me Barrett Alito and Thomas will rule in his favor no matter what
"Seriously. This usually comes at the city and state level. It's not like Republicans or Trump run on ""we need to give farmers roads"" or that Democrats are somehow against that. People also forget farmers, hunters, and fisherman are collectively less than 10% of rural populations."
I appreciate you
Hah cheers mate. Appreciated.
Yeah that seems pretty high but I assume that those are then not among the currently counted ones?
"That's the idea of a social yes. 

But there are people alive who don't have a social. Or they never got an official birth certificate. Or they had those documents but lost them. There are many reasons people don't have those things and are still legally eligible to vote. 

Like yeah I totally understand what you are saying you don't have to keep explaining it. There are just practical things that happen to people in their lives that keep that from being practical out of no fault of their own."
I know your joking but you are trying to encourage people to get their number of reports submitted number as high as possible.
"The really short version of the ""less sexist"" thing:

WAY back in Early Proto-Indo-European, before Anatolian even split, there were essentially only animate and inanimate nouns. -a- was infixed for specifically feminine things, which is sexist for more complicated reasons, but -o(s) vs -a(s) is historically more like ""not specifically feminine"" vs ""specifically feminine"". So switching over to everyone using ""masculine"" is more like removing the ""specifically feminine"" suffix."
"Yes. The autistic and Deaf communities are the main two opposed to people first language. At least in the case of the autistic community, it's because ""people *with* autism"" makes it sound separable from our identities at best, or curable at worst, as opposed to ""autistic person"" sounding more fundamental to our identities.

EDIT: Also, ""our"" because while I'm not officially diagnosed with anything, I strongly suspect I'm on the spectrum"
If you're not a student of history you've no business discussing it in any capacity.
Yeah pretty much

"The suggestion was that Biden would compromise on cabinet appointments in order to satisfy McConnell.  We're talking about cabinet appointments, but the only reason to satisfy McConnell is to be able to pass laws in the senate."
"Ive been an advocate for single payer universal healthcare for 30+ years.

Pretending Obamacare wasnt groundbreaking legislation passed through the senate and supreme court means you know next to nothing about the healthcare system.

And the people voted for Clinton in 2016.  

Her not getting enough support only completely screwed over Bernie Sanders, who was running to try to build political capital within an Clinton administration (and happened to get a lot of votes in the process, which was good.)   

Clinton losing screwed over Sanders massively, and Sanders asking the DNC to rig the election severely screwed Clinton as well with the far left.

Comey Barrett was appointed by the Trump administration, obviously.  No sane person is going to blame the democrats for 'fast tracking her.""

It's the job of the president to appoint judges.

Its YOUR job to appoint the president.

Guess you failed at your job there."
"Also I never called Bernie unrealistic, or AOC or OMAR or TLAIB.  Youre reaching as far as you can to do EXACTLY what you blame the libs for doing.

Which is precisely my point.

Time to get a grip on reality, mate.

Your ego is kind of maybe just slightly less important than the fate of the entire nation, although I know it might hurt to hear that."
"Ok, Imma still say no to defunding my county cause it went for Trump. But you do you, bro"
did you know that there's football on?
Yeah but just answering why it may go from 40K to 43K still to count.
"Sigh

You are looking at this the wrong way. I’ve tried to explain this to you but maybe i didnt do such a good job. The total number is absolutely meaningless. They cannot do anything with a number. What they are trying to do, is get someone with a legitimate story that they can point to on a stage and say “LOOK! THEY DIDNT LET HIM VOTE, HES HERE AND HE HAS THE PROOF!”

Without that, they have some stupid number that doesnt mean anything to anyone. A court isnt suddnely going to take their case because of some arbitrary number. Thats why the form asks for details. If they just wanted a number, this form could just be a fucking yes or no question."
Right. But when I'm  writing an English  sentence to a person and I  refer to a member of the Latin community and I  don't know the gender to use I should write Latino(a) or Latino/a rather than Latinx?
I'm actually a student of Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.
I have to say....if the AP gets this right...They will look like geniuses.
"Maybe you don’t get how “mathematically possible” works. Margin is 68,000 votes, 450k votes left to count. 

Whether something is Mathematically possible or not (0% chance vs >0%) does not factor in assumptions on trends, likelihood or realistic. Math is math. All ballots in theory could be trump. I agree they likely aren’t but it is a non-zero chance. 

Whereever there are votes outstanding greater than margin in the votes counted, there is a mathematical chance.

Wow. Can’t believe you don’t understand what mathematically possible means and how you misused the term."
"Ohhh you're one of those people, can't admit when you're wrong hey.

Cool, have a great day 👍"
"I don’t know what to tell you if you can look at all of McConnell’s career as majority leader and not see an obstructionist who takes what he can and runs with it. All that will happen is that the cabinet is chosen by McConnell and you still can’t pass shit. “Expanded ACA”, never going to happen with him around, no matter what."
">Ive been an advocate for single payer universal healthcare for 30+ years.

Good for you. But should Dem primary voters vote for candidates who support single payer or not? You seem to not want that.

>Pretending Obamacare wasnt groundbreaking legislation passed through the senate and supreme court means you know next to nothing about the healthcare system.

It has lots of pages, if that is what you mean. 

>And the people voted for Clinton in 2016.

She couldn't visit Wikipedia and learn about the electoral college?

>Her not getting enough support only completely screwed over Bernie Sanders, who was running to try to build political capital within an Clinton administration (and happened to get a lot of votes in the process, which was good.)

Bernie would be one of the least powerful members of the Senate if Clinton won. Hell, Clinton still hates him today, even after he did more rallies for her than she did for herself in the 2016 general election. And has she won, she would have governed like Bill Clinton, by doing triangulation. The first thing that Tom Perez did when he became DNC chair in 2017 was purge the already few Sanders supporter from the DNC and we would see even more of that if Clinton became president https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/10/tom-perez-dnc-shake-up

>Comey Barrett was appointed by the Trump administration, obviously. No sane person is going to blame the democrats for 'fast tracking her.""

Schumer literally fast-tracked her because he wanted to go ""on vacation"". And not only her, but dozens of judges were fast-tracked by Schumer. A lot of seats could be left empty for Biden to fill, but I guess you are OK with that because only the left-wing candidates deserve criticism, even when libs literally vote for Trump's bills and help McConnell fill judicial appointments. 

>Its YOUR job to appoint the president.

No, it is the job of candidates to win the swing states in general elections, the ""competent and knows how things work"" Clinton didn't do that. You want redditors to permanently move to Michigan and register to vote there to help Clinton win the election?

Why did Pelosi repeal parts of Obamacare, by the way? I would expect the unrealistic and crazy Bernie Sanders and AOC to do that, but not Pelosi!?"
"Libs call them unrealistic all the time, you seem to agree with them on everything and really don't want to criticize them. Are you OK with libs voting for Trump's war budget or not? You seem to be more mad at me personally and at the broader left than you are at Clinton for... you know...losing to a game show host."
"Defund them to hell. Tired of giving money to these racist, fascists counties so they can support their dictator."
Not really my vibe tbh. Im trying to work on my website to take my mind off of things but i keep switching tabs and everytime i refresh I just feel worse and worse. PA is giving me hope but i just have a feeling we wont get there and then its game over. I was so happy earlier but now im filled with dread
">they have some stupid number that doesnt mean anything to anyone.

It means something to 40% of the nation. They don't care if it holds up to scrutiny. They'll just keep repeating it over and over again to undermine trust in the election process.

Have you not been paying attention to the last 4 years?

I have been watching for these comments encouraging people to pump up the number and your response is just so much different than other people:

""I fear you are correct""

""Ah good point . ABORT MISSION""

""Astute observation. They don't care how ridiculous it is, they're doing everything they can to build a narrative of an unfair election.""

""Agreed, I realized that possibility after I posted and immediately replied with such. Appreciate you echoing that sentiment.""

You can play right into their hands if you want to but thankfully most people can see through what they are trying to do and refuse to help them."
"I just use Latino(s), like how waiter, actor, and similar are vaguely gender-neutral"
I mean if PA is called before giving Biden the win then they won't look as good as if AZ won it
[deleted]
I definitely see an obstructionist who takes what he can and runs with it.  But that wasn't my argument.  My point is simply that Biden's only hope to do anything of substance is if he can find a compromise with the senate.  Compromise doesn't make him a spineless idiot.  It makes him pragmatic.
"Its easy to tell that you have no bearing on reality because you think the biggest piece of healthcare reform legislation in the past 50 years that laid the groundwork for regulations to reign in healthcare costs - which is THE single biggest reason why other countries have affordable healthcare, the regulations themselves - is just a bunch of paperwork.

And you somehow think that Clinton knows less about the electoral college than you do.

And no, you dont havr to move to Michigan.  But since Clinton lost to Trump by less than 10,000 votes, with Stein taking in 50,000 and Johnson taking in nearly 200,000 maybe you should think about what youre saying.  

You didnt have to move, but Im going to go out on a limb and guess that you spent every waking minute complaining on social media about how people shouldnt trust the dems, or the DNC, vote third party, Bernie or Bust etc.  And YOU GOT what you wanted.

Know how I can tell?  Because its 2020 3 days past our latest election and youre still doing that.

And yeah, if you dont want it to be your job to elect the president you should move someplace that doesn't make it the fundamental right of the citizens to vote for the appointment of a new president.

And yeah, Bernie lost the primary in no small part because, as the Kaiser Family Foundation has noted in every study, Americans still cling to the idea of keeping their private insurance - and he decided his biggest opponent was the democratic party itself, and not the AMA, or the Republicans.

I really do appreciate you coming in to PROVE every point I made in my original comment, but I thought I was replying to someone on the left, not whatever PROGRESSIVE IN NAME ONLY sort of garbage youve obviously adopted as your mantra."
"You know how I can tell you arent a progressive?

Because you think Clinton was the one who lost.

Youre GLAD she lost.  Youre happy to be able to gloat about her losing to Donald Trump.

We lost as a nation.  For you though, it was a win.  You wanted that to be the result.

You GOT what you wanted when Trump won.

As far as Im concerned, WE lost in 2016.  And we lost as a nation.

But you gloat about it just like the republicans, because you still cant see well enough to realize your own reinforcing every point Ive made."
"im here with you my man. 
Maricopa county reports in 20, That's the Dem Stronghold in AZ and where everyone lives."
"If they wanted numbers, this form would only have one field. The more fields a form has the less likely people are to complete it. I’ll delete the comment for you because this argument is pedantic."
Weren't you the one saying Latino/a was preferable?
Can’t believe you can’t say “I was wrong” but just like trump I guess you don’t care when you’re wrong you just say shit that isn’t true.
Let’s just agree to hope the GA runoffs work out and this is a non-issue.
"Are you doing OK? You really are reaching as far as you can. Did I hurt your ego?

>We lost as a nation. For you though, it was a win. You wanted that to be the result.

Yes, I really wanted Trump to win, that is why I keep criticizing the Dems for voting for his stupid bills and giving him more ICE funding. Because I love Trump.

>your own reinforcing every point Ive made.

""I am ignoring most of your questions and responses and keep attacking you personally because you just don't realize how much I'm owning you"". HAHA."
"Im not a religious man, infact im quite the opposite; the only time i've ever prayed before in my life is when my 4 year old was on life support. But my god im actually praying now for PA to flip or arizona to stay blue. And now iv'e seen reports of NV residents voting when they no longer live there. I just have such a bad feeling about this, its just gone to well for us"
"Sigh. Looks like you are going to remain willfully blind to how you are helping them.

To accomplish what? To submit something obnoxious that many not even be read?

That would be like trying to convince a blind person that the Mona Lisa does not have eyebrows, despite their insistance."
"well, to be fair, it's gone terribly for us."

AZ data dump isnt great, but it's what is expected.

we still win."

">Ive no need to entertain the questions of someone who, when contested, would assert that a Senate minority leader is in charge of appointing judges.

I never said that LMAO. You just keep making things up. I said he fast-tracked lots of GOP judges, including Barrett. Are you high or something? I also said that there would be more empty judicial seats (for your boy Biden to fill) if Schumer had not constantly fast-tracked judges."
